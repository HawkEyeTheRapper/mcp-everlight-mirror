how do i make my mac show up on my ipad scren

To make your **Mac** screen show up on your **iPad**, you can use **Apple's Sidecar** feature or third-party apps depending on what you want to do:

---

## ✅ **Option 1: Sidecar (Built-in, Free, Apple-supported)**  
**Use your iPad as a second display for your Mac**

### 🧩 Requirements:
- Mac with macOS Catalina or later
- iPad with iPadOS 13 or later
- Same Apple ID on both devices
- Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and Handoff enabled
- Devices within ~10 meters of each other

### 🔧 How to Set Up:
1. **On your Mac**, go to the Apple menu → **System Settings** (or “System Preferences” on older macOS).
2. Go to **Displays**.
3. Click the **“Add Display”** or “+” button.
4. Select your **iPad** from the list.
5. Your iPad will now show up as a second screen (mirrored or extended).

### 🖐 Extra Tips:
- You can **mirror your Mac** screen or **extend the desktop**.
- Use **Apple Pencil** on iPad to interact with Mac apps!

---

## ✅ **Option 2: Universal Control (Interactive, not screen mirroring)**  
**Control both devices with a single mouse/keyboard, but NOT a display extension.**

Good for dragging files, typing across both, etc.  
Enable it via **System Settings → Displays → Universal Control**

---

## 🔁 **Option 3: Third-Party Apps (More Flexibility)**
If Sidecar doesn’t work or you need more control, try:

### 🔸 **Duet Display**
- Works with older macOS/iPadOS
- Wired or wireless
- https://www.duetdisplay.com

### 🔸 **Luna Display**
- Hardware-based; extremely low latency
- Great for pro use
- https://astropad.com/product/lunadisplay/

---

## 🛠 Common Issues
- Sidecar won’t show iPad? Make sure:
  - Same Apple ID on both
  - Bluetooth + Wi-Fi ON
  - Logged into iCloud
  - Devices are compatible (Sidecar doesn’t work on some older models)

---

If you're trying to do the *reverse* (see your **iPad on your Mac**), that’s a different setup — let me know if that’s what you meant.

how do i mirror it to my ipad screen - i have it on but i only have a keyboard to enter things i can’t see my mac screen currently

Got it — you're flying blind on the Mac and want to **mirror your Mac’s screen onto your iPad** so you can see what you’re doing. Here's the **fastest possible way to mirror your Mac to your iPad using only your keyboard**, assuming Sidecar is enabled and working:

---

## 🧠 TL;DR: Use Sidecar with Keyboard Only

### 🔑 Try This Keyboard Sequence on the Mac:
1. **Press `Command + Space`** to open **Spotlight**.
2. Type: `Displays`
3. Hit `Return` (this opens Display Settings).
4. Press `Tab` several times until you land on the “Add Display” button (or shift focus around with arrow keys).
5. Press `Space` or `Return` to open the dropdown.
6. Use arrow keys to select your **iPad** from the list.
7. Press `Return`.

Your iPad should now show the Mac screen — either **mirrored** or **extended** (you can adjust later once you have visibility).

---

## 🧪 Alternative If That Doesn’t Work
Use **VoiceOver** (macOS’s screen reader) to navigate:

1. **Press `Command + F5`** to turn on **VoiceOver**.
2. Then repeat the steps above, listening to VoiceOver guide you through the interface.
3. Once the screen is mirrored, you can turn VoiceOver off with `Command + F5` again.

---

## ✅ Once iPad Is Showing the Screen:
You can go back into **Display Settings** on the Mac to:
- Change from “extended” to “mirror” display.
- Rearrange screens if needed.

---

If this doesn’t kick in Sidecar and your iPad doesn’t light up, let me know your:
- macOS version
- iPadOS version
- Whether you’re using USB or Wi-Fi
- If you have any third-party tools installed like Duet or Luna

I can then guide you with a more specific recovery sequence.
