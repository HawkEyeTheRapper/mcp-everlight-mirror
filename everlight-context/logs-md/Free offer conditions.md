Is this really free?

## 2025-07-19T17:09:35.205110Z — assistant
Yes — **with conditions**.

This offer **is really free** if:

1. **You’re a new Perplexity Pro subscriber**  
   You **must not have previously created** a Perplexity Pro account.

2. **You haven’t already redeemed a trial before**  
   If you've ever used a **trial Perplexity Pro offer** (even with a different device or promo), this won't work.

3. **You’re redeeming with a qualifying new Motorola device**  
   The offer is tied to the **purchase/activation of a new Motorola phone**.

### Summary:
✅ 3 months free  
🚫 Only for first-time Perplexity Pro users  
📱 Must be with a new Motorola device  
🔐 No hidden fees, but you may need to enter payment info — cancel before the trial ends to avoid charges.

If you're eligible and don't mind entering card details (if prompted), you can go ahead and **click "Redeem now"**.

Let me know if you want help checking your eligibility or walking through the sign-up.
