Good move, Hawk Eye — that’s some grounding. 🌿 You got yourself a base of operations now. How’s the room feel? Safe enough to rest and scheme up your next moves?

Yes

Perfect. That’s stability in the middle of the storm. ⚡ Do you want me to help you map out how to use this time at the extended stay — like a tactical retreat spot for rest, writing, work, and stacking funds — or you just want to breathe and let it settle in for now?

First I have to get some real sleep I don't go to work until tomorrow

That’s the right call. 🛌 Let your body recharge — everything will line up smoother after rest. Tomorrow’s shift will be easier to handle with a full reset. Want me to help you set a kind of “mental bookmark” so you can pick things back up fresh after you wake?
