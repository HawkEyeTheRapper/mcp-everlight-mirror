Nah it’s all good there’s no way to just bypass this crap on the tablet with the right key pressed lol

## 2025-05-23T02:13:26.109593Z — assistant
Ha — sadly, no magic button combo will let you bypass a managed Apple device’s MDM lock (Mobile Device Management). If you're seeing that "Remote Management" screen on setup, that tablet is enrolled in an organization’s MDM profile, and:

**You can’t bypass it** without:
- The Apple ID or credentials of the managing org, **or**
- Proper removal via Apple Business Manager / Apple Configurator with proof of ownership.

### That said, here are your real-world options:

#### 1. **Contact the Previous Owner or Seller**
If you bought the device used, ask them to remove it from their Apple Business account. They must:
- Log in at [business.apple.com](https://business.apple.com)
- Remove the device from MDM enrollment

#### 2. **Use Apple Configurator (Mac only)**
This only works if:
- You have a Mac
- The iPad is supervised by you (not enrolled through DEP/ABM)

Even then, **MDM lock remains unless the device was enrolled manually.** If it was enrolled automatically via Apple’s Device Enrollment Program (DEP), **you’re stuck** unless the original org releases it.

#### 3. **Third-Party MDM Bypass Tools**
Tools like 3uTools or Tenorshare 4uKey claim to bypass MDM, but:
- **They may be illegal depending on local laws**
- **They often don’t work on newer iOS versions (especially iOS 15 and above)**
- **They may brick your device or expose you to malware**

#### 4. **Return It or Request a Refund**
If you got this from eBay, Facebook Marketplace, or elsewhere and weren’t told it was MDM-locked — **file a return ASAP.**

---

**TL;DR:**  
There’s no “key” you can press to bypass MDM — Apple’s ecosystem is locked down tight. If you want me to check the IMEI or serial number for its status, I can walk you through that too.

Want to see if it’s even DEP locked or just locally enrolled?
