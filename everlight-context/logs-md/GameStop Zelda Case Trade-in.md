Will GameStop buy this Zelda Nintendo switch case as well?

Yes, GameStop will buy your **Zelda-themed Nintendo Switch carrying case**, but don’t expect much. They currently show a generic "Carrying Case for Nintendo Switch (Styles May Vary)" trade-in value of **up to $0.01**—that’s one cent, either in store credit or cash citeturn0search0.

So even though your case is Zelda-branded, GameStop treats all cases the same—brands or designs typically don’t add extra value. You’ll get basically nothing from trading it in there. If you’re looking to make something for it, resale through a platform like eBay, Mercari, or Facebook Marketplace would likely get you significantly more.

Got you. If you're trying to scrape together some extra for gas or essentials, pawn shops or local resell apps might get you more for stuff like that. If you’re ever unsure what’s worth pawning, flipping, or holding onto, I got you.
