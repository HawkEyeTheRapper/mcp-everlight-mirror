You're not alone—this type of vague rejection from Amazon Merch on Demand happens often, and unfortunately, they rarely give specific details. But let’s break it down and get to the bottom of **why** this keeps happening, especially with your "Pale Rider - Behold A Pale Horse Collection."

---

### 🔍 Likely Causes for Rejection

Here are the **most common reasons** designs like yours get flagged, especially given the *"Behold A Pale Horse"* title:

#### 1. **Sensitive or Controversial Content**
Amazon’s policy often targets anything that:
- References **violence**, **death**, or **militant themes**
- Touches on **conspiracy theories** (your title is the same as the famous William Cooper book)
- Could be interpreted as **political** or **anti-government**, even if it’s artistic or symbolic

#### 2. **Title or Description Flags**
Even if the *design art* itself is safe, **Amazon scans metadata**:
- “Pale Rider” + “Behold A Pale Horse” can trigger flags due to associations with Biblical apocalyptic themes or William Cooper’s controversial legacy
- If you mentioned anything like “awakening,” “truth,” “rebellion,” etc., in the product description, it could have triggered content violation filters

#### 3. **Visual Content (if reviewed)**
If your artwork includes:
- Skulls, horses of death, symbols that can be misinterpreted as violent, political, or religious—it could trigger automatic or manual review rejection

### ✅ What You Can Do Right Now

#### Step 1: **Review the full content policy**
👉 [Amazon Merch Content Policy](https://merch.amazon.com/resource/201858630)

Focus especially on:
- **Violence and Dangerous Organizations**
- **Hate Speech / Insensitive Content**
- **Content Related to Current Events or Conspiracies**

---

#### Step 2: **Try This Safer Resubmission Strategy**
- **Rename the product** — instead of “Pale Rider – Behold A Pale Horse,” try:
  - **“The Fourth Rider”**
  - **“Shadow of the Pale Horse”**
  - **“Omniversal Rider”**
  - Or something mythic/poetic that *evokes the theme without the trigger words*

- **Scrub the description** of any language that hints at:
  - Conspiracies, rebellion, or anti-authority ideas (even metaphorical ones)
  - Anything that sounds like social critique

- **If applicable**: Tone down imagery if it includes skulls, weapons, religious icons, or anything “apocalyptic”

---

### 💡 Optional Plan B: Dual Distribution
Let’s:
- **List the design elsewhere too**: like on your [Reincarnated2Resist.com](https://Reincarnated2Resist.com) store
- **Sell a variant through Patreon, Gumroad, or Shopify**—which offer more freedom

I can help clean up your product title, description, and art metadata to pass Amazon’s filter next time. Just send me the art file or original text you used in your listing, and I’ll give you a compliant version to try again.

Would you like me to generate a safe version of the product title + description now?
