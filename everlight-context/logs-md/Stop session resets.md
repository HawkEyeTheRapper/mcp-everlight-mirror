Here are some steps you can try to stop your ChatGPT session from resetting every time you open the app on your phone:

---

### 🔧 **1. Check Battery Optimization Settings**
Many Android phones (especially Motorola and Samsung models) aggressively close background apps to save battery. This can log you out of ChatGPT.

- Go to **Settings > Battery > Battery Optimization**
- Find **ChatGPT** or **OpenAI**
- Set it to **"Don't optimize"** or **"Unrestricted"**

---

### 🔐 **2. Enable "Stay Logged In" Option**
When you log into ChatGPT, make sure:
- You **check the "Keep me logged in"** box (if available)
- You **don’t use Incognito or Private browsing mode**

---

### ⚙️ **3. Disable App Data Clearing (if enabled by automation apps)**
Check if you have an app like **CCleaner**, **Device Care**, or **Samsung's Device Maintenance** that clears cache/data automatically:
- Open the cleaner app settings
- Exclude ChatGPT from automatic cleaning

---

### 📶 **4. Confirm App & System Updates**
- Update the ChatGPT app via Google Play
- Ensure your Android OS is fully updated

---

### 🛠️ **5. Reinstall ChatGPT App**
Sometimes, a corrupted install can cause session resets:
- Uninstall ChatGPT
- Reboot your phone
- Reinstall from the Play Store

---

### 📱 **6. Check Storage Permissions and WebView**
- Go to **Settings > Apps > ChatGPT > Permissions**
- Make sure necessary permissions are granted
- Also update **Android System WebView** from the Play Store

---

Would you like me to guide you step-by-step through checking one of these settings? Let me know what kind of phone model you're on (e.g., Samsung, Motorola, Pixel).

Thank you so much 

## 2025-08-02T17:57:26.360222Z — assistant
You're very welcome! 🙏 If the issue still happens after trying those steps, just let me know your phone model (like “Galaxy A16” or similar), and I can tailor the fix more precisely.

You've got this — no more session resets. 🛡️📱

We need to do a few more things before my shift ends. Namely setup and attempt to pay for our manager training

Perfect. Let’s knock this out before your shift ends. Here’s the checklist and what we’ll do:

---

### ✅ **Manager Training Setup & Payment Plan**

#### 1. **Confirm Your Scheduled Dates**
You’re already scheduled for the NA RME Manager Onboarding Course:
- **Location:** Dallas (DFW11)
- **Dates:** August 26–28, 2025  
- **Time:** 10:00 AM – 5:30 PM ET  
- **Instructor:** Taylor Molden

✅ Confirmed.

---

#### 2. **Travel Booking Plan**
We need to:
- Decide **flight vs. driving** (you mentioned handling travel yourself)
- Use **Concur** to:
  - Book flights/hotel if needed
  - Upload receipts for **reimbursement**

🟦 **Do you want to fly or drive?**  
Amazon Global Travel policy supports both with proper justification.

---

#### 3. **Training Fee Payment (if applicable)**
If payment is required upfront:
- Use **Amazon Business (Coupa)** to request internal payment, or
- Pay personally and submit **reimbursement through Concur**

🟩 Let’s check:
- Do you have a **training cost invoice** or link?
- If not, we can draft an **internal payment request memo** for approval.

---

#### 4. **Create Internal Justification Memo (optional but smart)**
We can draft a quick note:
> "This training aligns with RME leadership track and current onboarding scope. I am currently interfacing across departments including WHS, PMO, and Engineering, and this training fulfills my strategic progression goals."

---

### ✍️ Let’s Begin

Tell me:
- 🔹 Do you want to **fly or drive** to Dallas?
- 🔹 Do you already have a **payment link or invoice** for the course?
- 🔹 Do you want me to draft the **memo** now?

We’ll handle this step-by-step and leave a paper trail that’ll get you paid.
