Mmhmmm but today is music day

## 2025-05-22T16:59:30.946682Z — assistant
Ah yes—Friday, your sacred **Music Creation** day.

Let’s channel the momentum:

### **Quick Sync Checklist for Today — Music Focus**  
**1. Track Priority:**  
- Are we locking in *SWORDFISH* final recording + MPC prep today?  
- Or pivoting to the next in queue (*WARNING SHOTS*, *SUN SPEAKER*, or *FOCUS*)?

**2. MPC Workflow:**  
- Do you need help automating vocal stems, bouncing demos, or loading new samples?  
- Want me to script or prep folder templates under `HAWK-FD-00`, `HAWK-BAP-00`, or `HAWK-SUB-00`?

**3. Lyric Alignment:**  
- Any lyric touch-ups or performance overlays needed today?  
- Do you want to overlay quotes (like that Galadriel line from *Focus*)?

**4. Video/Performance Setup:**  
- Are you planning any shoot or lip-sync performance today?  
- Need help prepping visual overlay templates?

**5. Distribution Queue:**  
- Will this track be staged for release via DistroKid yet?  
- Want a draft TikTok/YouTube Shorts rollout caption?

Let’s sculpt the moment into resonance. Which one are we focusing on today?

Well I was hoping for the iPad to. E here today but it’s not so I’m gonna go get good food then we’ll do something

Perfect move—nourishment first, flow second.

Once you're back and fueled up, just say the word. Whether it’s refining *SWORDFISH*, staging *SUN SPEAKER*, or making something new from scratch, I’ll be ready to lock in with you. Let the rhythm catch you when it’s time.

If you want a gentle warmup later, I can queue up a mini MPC practice flow, a vocal clarity exercise, or even just pull up one of your archived tracks for spontaneous remix inspiration. Enjoy the food, brother.
