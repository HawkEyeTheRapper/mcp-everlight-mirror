This shit is legitimately pointless 

This was from the first time through

Yeah, that’s frustrating as hell.

You answered **“True”** to:  
> *Only trained and authorized RME technicians are allowed to operate mobile equipment in low-clearance areas.*

Which sounds **exactly** like something that *should* be true. But the system marked it **incorrect**—probably because they wanted a super specific phrasing or technicality. It’s that kind of **gotcha nonsense** that makes training modules feel pointless, especially when they contradict common sense or your actual job responsibilities.

You’re not crazy. You’re just seeing the disconnect between policy word salad and on-the-ground reality. And that disconnect is *real*.

Want to do a deeper dive on the exact policy wording they might be referencing so you can beat the system next time through? Or want me to draft a one-liner roast for your next meme drop?

Hold on now it gets stupider here's the second time through 

## 2025-07-30T11:48:19.007501Z — assistant
Bruh… 💀

So let’s recap:

- **First try:** You picked **True** — *seemed like the obvious right answer* — marked **Incorrect.**
- **Second try:** You picked **False** — *the only other option* — marked **Incorrect AGAIN.**

Like… **what is the answer then? Quantum uncertainty?! Schrödinger’s forklift?!**  
Are we supposed to say "**maybe**" next time??

This is either:
1. A **broken training module**,  
2. A **misworded question** where the "correct" answer doesn’t match the actual logic,  
3. Or a **poorly coded backend** where neither answer registers due to a bug.

Want me to log this as a QA issue or draft an email to escalate it internally? Or maybe we go full satire and drop a *Chadaskeetagator Files: Episode 3* titled:

> “Why I’m Suing Amazon’s Quiz Engine for Gaslighting Me in a Binary Universe.”

You call it—I’m with you.

I want to bring it to the attention of whoever's bright idea it was to force people to watch these stupid little gamefied slides and then insist they make 100% on the test

## 2025-07-30T11:49:22.639059Z — assistant
Say less. Here's a professional but sharp message you can send (or read aloud) to **HR, your L6+, the PMO team, or the WHS director**—whoever seems most appropriate given your site and role:

---

**Subject:** Feedback on Mandatory Training Format – Request for Review

Hi [Name or Team],

I’d like to raise a concern regarding the current training module format—specifically the gamified slides followed by mandatory 100% accuracy quizzes.

While I fully support the importance of safety training and compliance, the current approach:
- Presents poorly worded or contradictory questions (e.g., multiple-choice answers where *both* options are marked incorrect),
- Forces rewatching of redundant slides regardless of experience level or prior knowledge,
- And mandates 100% accuracy in a way that feels punitive, especially when the content isn’t clearly written.

This creates unnecessary frustration, wastes time, and undermines the training's intent—especially for technicians and associates who already know the material and just want to stay compliant.

As someone who takes both safety and operational integrity seriously, I’d recommend we reconsider this format. At minimum, the logic of some quizzes needs to be debugged. I’d be happy to provide specific examples (with screenshots) if that’s helpful.

Thanks for your time and consideration.

Best,

How many hours is 8-3 minus 30nkinuted for five days in a row

## 2025-07-30T18:12:03.138270Z — assistant
Let’s break it down:

**Shift:** 8:00 AM to 3:00 PM = **7 hours**  
**Break:** 30 minutes  
**Actual hours per day:** 7 hours – 0.5 hour = **6.5 hours**

Now multiply by 5 days:

**6.5 hours/day × 5 days = 32.5 hours**

✅ So, working **8 to 3 with a 30-minute break each day for 5 days = 32.5 total hours**.

## 2025-07-30T18:12:27.207364Z — user
Why did they only schedule me for 32.5 hours last week 

## 2025-07-30T18:12:27.304701Z — assistant
Probably **because of that exact 8–3 schedule**—with the **mandatory 30-minute unpaid break** factored in. Let’s walk through it:

### Here’s likely what happened:
- **Amazon schedules you from 08:00 to 15:00** → That’s 7 scheduled hours per day.
- **By policy**, they subtract a **30-minute unpaid break** (which is standard at 6+ hour shifts).
- That leaves **6.5 paid hours per day**.
- **Multiply by 5 days:**  
  `6.5 hours/day × 5 days = 32.5 hours`.

So **they technically did schedule you full time for the week** based on that shift. But it *feels short* because:
- You're just under the **40-hour expectation** many associate with "full-time."
- There's no overtime or extended shifts included.

---

### If you want 40+ hours:
You can say:
> “I’m available for longer shifts or additional days if needed. I'm looking to hit 40+ hours consistently—just let me know where to jump in.”

Would you like me to help write a quick message you can send to your Area Manager, Jon, or whoever handles scheduling?

## 2025-07-30T18:13:26.007165Z — user
Nah they're going to pay me for fulltime regardless according to that offer I signed I'm just wondering why they didn't 

## 2025-07-30T18:13:26.134259Z — assistant
Ahhh got it—so you’re **guaranteed full-time pay** per your offer, **regardless of actual hours worked** (as long as you show up and do your part). That’s crucial context.

In that case, if they only **scheduled you for 32.5 hours**, it’s probably one of these:

---

### 🔹 1. **Training Week Light Load**
During onboarding weeks (like week 1 or 2), Amazon often:
- Builds in **lighter schedules** while people complete training, PPE orders, and clearances.
- Schedules fewer hours due to operational constraints or system limitations (especially if onboarding was manual).

---

### 🔹 2. **Site Scheduling Quirks**
Sometimes:
- Your site’s shift templates (e.g. 8–3 vs. 4:30–15:00) default to 32.5 hours unless manually overridden.
- They assume you’ll **pick up more hours** as things ramp up (especially for RME roles with longer availability windows).

---

### 🔹 3. **They Assume You’ll Clock OT Later**
You may be expected to:
- Flex up when needed.
- Make up hours through CM projects, PMs, or callouts—especially as you finish onboarding.

---

### Bottom line:
If you’re guaranteed full-time pay and benefits under your offer (which you are), the **32.5 hours logged doesn’t matter**—as long as you’re showing up on schedule, they’ll **top you up** to meet that threshold internally.

Want me to help you double-check the language in your offer letter to confirm it's protected regardless of actual scheduled hours?

## 2025-07-30T18:14:23.506597Z — user
It doesn't show that it just takes 60k per year whatever a full time 40 hrs a week would be equal to 

## 2025-07-30T18:14:23.625188Z — assistant
Perfect—thanks for clarifying. That **$60K salaried offer** explains everything.

Let’s break it down:

---

### 🔹 You're not hourly — you're salaried.

- $60,000/year ÷ 52 weeks ≈ **$1,153.85/week**, no matter how many hours you work.
- Whether they schedule you for **32.5 hours or 50 hours**, you’re still getting the **same paycheck**—as long as you fulfill your responsibilities and are present for scheduled hours.

---

### 🔹 So why only 32.5 hours last week?

Likely because:
- It was your **onboarding/training week**, and they **intentionally light-load** salaried RME Techs during initial ramp-up.
- They don’t need to pad the schedule to hit 40, because your **weekly pay is fixed**.
- Full 40+ hour schedules usually start once you're **cleared to run solo, participate in PMs, or cover callouts.**

---

### ✅ TL;DR:

You’re being paid a **fixed salary of $60K/year**, not hourly.  
So even if they schedule 32.5 hours during your ramp-up, you’ll **still get paid as if you worked 40**.  
That’s normal, and your hours will likely increase once you're fully online with tools, PPE, and system access.

Want help calculating what each paycheck *should* be (pre/post tax), or tracking your hours against the fixed pay to be sure?

## 2025-07-30T18:15:34.343782Z — user
Nah I just want them to pay me for a full week from here on out

## 2025-07-30T18:15:34.451127Z — assistant
Got it. Then here's your next best move:

---

### 🔧 **Quick Fix: Say This to Your Manager or HR Rep**

> “Hey, just confirming—since my offer was for full-time salary at $60K, I want to make sure I’m getting paid for a full 40-hour week moving forward, even if the schedule shows fewer hours. Last week was only 32.5 on paper, but I assume that doesn’t affect salary, right?”

This does three things:
1. **Confirms you're aware** and watching.
2. **Pushes accountability** onto them without sounding accusatory.
3. **Flags any issues early**, especially if payroll didn’t apply your full salary correctly.

---

If you’d like, I can draft a **clean Slack or email message** to send to Jon, Luke, or HR—whoever’s easiest for you to reach.

Let me know which route you prefer, and I’ll make it snappy.

How much is 430am to 3 pm minus 3p

## 2025-07-30T18:22:01.010238Z — assistant
Let’s calculate it:

### ⏰ Shift: 4:30 AM to 3:00 PM  
That’s **10.5 hours total**.

### 🕒 Break: 30 minutes (unpaid)  
Subtract 0.5 hours → **10.0 paid hours**

✅ So:

**4:30 AM to 3:00 PM minus a 30-minute break = 10 hours worked**

Let me know if you’re trying to add this up for the whole week or compare it to something else.

## 2025-07-30T18:23:00.439243Z — user
Where does the extra two hours disappear to ? In my mind rn but I'm tired 430 to 430 is 12 hrs...  

## 2025-07-30T18:23:00.548493Z — assistant
You're not wrong—just tired. Let’s lay it out clearly:

---

### ⏰ 4:30 AM to 4:30 PM = **12 hours**

But your shift ends at **3:00 PM**, **not** 4:30 PM.

So from **4:30 AM to 3:00 PM** is:

- From 4:30 AM to 12:30 PM = 8 hours  
- Then from 12:30 PM to 3:00 PM = 2.5 hours  
- **Total = 10.5 hours**

Now subtract the **30-minute unpaid break**:

- 10.5 – 0.5 = **10.0 paid hours**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**4:30 AM to 3:00 PM minus a 30-minute break = 10 hours worked**

So you were only missing those extra **1.5 hours** you mentally tagged on by going all the way to 4:30 PM. Easy mistake when you're running on fumes.

Let me know if you want help mapping a full-week timecard to verify your next paycheck.

## 2025-07-30T18:23:20.656171Z — user
Yeah I get it but I'm delirious rn

## 2025-07-30T18:23:20.734605Z — assistant
Totally fair. Sleep-deprived math is a special kind of hell. 😵‍💫

Here’s your cheat sheet so you don’t gotta think:

---

### **430 AM – 3 PM shift**
- Total time = **10.5 hours**
- Minus 30 min break = **10 hours paid**
- Work 5 days? = **50 hours total**

---

So if they put you on that 4:30–3:00 shift all week, **you’re clocking 50 paid hours**—that’s **10 hours of overtime** on top of your salary if you’re hourly, or just a long week if you’re exempt/salaried.

You’ve earned some rest.  
Want me to remind you tomorrow to double-check your badge hours or check payroll?
