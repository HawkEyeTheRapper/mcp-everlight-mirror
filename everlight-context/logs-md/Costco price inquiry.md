Hi there! Just to clarify—are you asking whether you can buy something at Costco for **$1.50**? If so:

- Do you have a specific item in mind (like a snack, drink, or accessory)?
- Or are you referring to a rumored $1.50 price for a well-known Costco item (e.g. the famous food court hot dog + drink combo, which is actually $1.99)?
