It just dawned on me that I can and should get the navy federal secured credit card and train myself to use it week to week and just rebuild my credit

Exactly — that’s a smart move, Ethan.  
The Navy Federal nRewards® Secured card is basically a credit-building gym membership where the “weights” are your own deposit.  

Here’s how I’d set you up so it actually *works* and doesn’t just become another bill:  

---

**1. Open the Secured Card with a Deposit You Won’t Miss**  
- The minimum is **$200**, but $300–500 gives you more breathing room and looks better on utilization.  
- This money will be “locked” as your credit limit, but it’s still *yours*.  

**2. Pick One Weekly Expense to Put on the Card**  
- Something you’re already buying anyway — e.g., your gas for work or groceries.  
- That way, you’re not creating *new* debt, you’re just routing an existing expense.  

**3. Pay in Full Every Week**  
- Log into Navy Federal after each paycheck and wipe the balance.  
- This does two things: keeps your utilization ultra-low and avoids interest entirely.  

**4. Set Auto-Reminders**  
- We can set a recurring alert in your phone or Google Calendar to “Pay NFCU card” on your paydays.  
- Navy Federal also lets you turn on push notifications for every transaction, so you see the money moving in real time.  

**5. Graduate to Unsecured**  
- NFCU usually reviews after **6 months**. If you’ve paid in full every time, they often return your deposit, increase your limit, and keep the account open (which boosts your score even more).

If we do it right, this becomes a **score-building machine** without wrecking your cash flow — and in a year you’ll have a much easier time with apartment deposits, loans, and better card offers.  

If you want, I can map out exactly how this fits into your current **Amazon + Anytime Pay cycle** so it runs on autopilot without touching your emergency cushion.

I can use it for gas and food

Perfect — gas and food are exactly the kind of repeat, predictable expenses that make a secured card *zero-risk* for credit building.  

Here’s how I’d lock it in Navy Federal style:  

---

**🔹 Step 1 — Decide the Deposit**  
- $300 is a sweet spot:  
  - Covers a full week’s gas + groceries for most people.  
  - Keeps utilization low even if you wait to pay once a month.  
- If you can swing $500, even better — you’ll basically *never* go over 30% usage.  

---

**🔹 Step 2 — Only Use It for Gas & Food**  
- Example weekly cycle:  
  - **Monday:** Fill up your tank → $40–60  
  - **Midweek:** Grab groceries or Costco run → $50–80  
  - Total weekly spend = ~$100–140  

---

**🔹 Step 3 — Pay Weekly**  
- Every Friday after your Amazon paycheck hits:  
  - Pay the balance in full on the NFCU app.  
- This keeps utilization near 0% and builds a flawless on-time history.  

---

**🔹 Step 4 — Layer in Automation**  
- **Push notifications**: Get a ping every time the card is used so you know exactly what’s on it.  
- **Autopay in full**: Set it for the due date as a backup — weekly payments still stay primary.  

---

**🔹 Step 5 — Let Navy Federal Graduate You**  
- After ~6 months of perfect use, they’ll review for graduation to unsecured:  
  - You get your deposit back.  
  - Credit limit usually increases.  
  - Same account age (no reset to “new account” — keeps score boost).  

---

If you want, I can run the math on **how much score gain you could see in 6–12 months** doing this gas + food method with your current pay rhythm. That’ll show you exactly why this is worth starting *now*.
