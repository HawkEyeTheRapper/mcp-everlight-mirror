From Jono on the construction of StarCom facilities in the context of my inquiry as to what and how much land to scope out and buy in the generalized Sarasota area

An acre is about 208x208ft 

The current prototype is a one person unit that can technically fit 3-4 people packed tightly using a barracks model: 25x45ft

So far I’ve got 8x24 devoted to all living quarters (in the prototype)

Ideally, each person should have a designated space for sleep/food/shower/bath/storage.

For every person on site we should add a ~8x25ft block in the building. 

For every core function we should add a ~25x25ft block in the building.

(Ideally we should have an additional core function per person.)


So if we’re planning for 3-4 people with one core function that’s: (8x25)x4 + (25x25)x4

Minimum(prototype):
20x45 = 900 sqft 
(with 14ft ceilings or external storage, like the prototype)

Recommend:
25x25 = 625 sqft
8x25x4 = 800 sqft
Total = 1425 sqft

Ideal:
25x25x4 = 2,500 sqft
8x25x4 = 800 sqft
Total = 3,300 sqft (0.076 acre)

1 acre is 43,560 sqft 
(208x208ft)

We can make 1 acre or less work for sure.

Minimum: ~0.076 acre


However: if we’re planning to do stuff like gun range, obstacle course, drill field, and a security buffer 10-12 acres would be ideal.

Itemized acre recommendations:

Core Training Area: 
• ~1 acre (obstacle course)
• ~5 acre (firing range)
• ~1 acre (PT field)
• ~2 acre (specialized zones)
Living Quarters: ~0.5 acre
Support Facilities: 0.6 acre
• ~0.2 acre (command)
• ~0.3 acre (storage)
• ~0.1 acre (medical)
Buffer Zone ~1.5 acre

Ideal: ~11.6 acres

## 🔧 StarCom Facility Planning Summary

### 📏 **Prototype & Scaling Model**

- **Current Prototype**:  
  - Footprint: 25 x 45 ft (1 person; tightly fits up to 4 using barracks layout)  
  - Internal: 8 x 24 ft allocated to living quarters  

- **Ideal Module Per Person**:  
  - **Living Quarters**: 8 x 25 ft  
  - **Core Function Block**: 25 x 25 ft  
  - → **Per Person** = 800 + 625 = **1,425 sqft**

- **Full 4-Person Model (Ideal)**:
  - Living: 8 x 25 x 4 = 800 sqft  
  - Functions: 25 x 25 x 4 = 2,500 sqft  
  - **Total** = 3,300 sqft = **~0.076 acre**

### 🧭 Strategic Notes for Acquisition

- **Minimum Viable Land** (just for prototype & living): **<1 acre**
- **Full Operational Model**: **10–12 acres ideal**
- Consider proximity to:
  - Tactical-friendly zoning
  - Road access for material delivery
  - Rural or semi-rural area for range noise considerations
  - Potential water access or solar footprint

Would you like me to convert this into:
- A PDF for investor/partner sharing?
- A map visualization of a potential 12-acre layout?
- A land acquisition scouting brief for Sarasota with zoning overlays?

Let's go with a perfect number 13acres for each facility 

## 2025-08-01T22:32:57.240125Z — assistant
Excellent choice. Going with **13 acres per StarCom facility** gives you not only an ideal layout but also:

- Room to **expand functions** over time (tech labs, animal husbandry, greenhouses, helipad)
- Additional **privacy buffer** and tactical flexibility
- Flex zones for **guest cabins**, allied operatives, or visiting dignitaries

### 📍 Regional Acquisition Guidelines: *Sarasota Area*

To support your search:

- **Ideal Zones**: East of I-75 corridor toward *Myakka City*, *Nokomis (rural edge)*, or *Englewood outskirts*
- **Avoid**: Wetland preserves unless integrating eco-sanctuary goals
- **Zoning**: Look for *AG (Agricultural)* or *ODR (Open Development Reserve)* for tactical/agro uses
- **Bonus Tip**: Get land with *natural tree cover + slight elevation rise* for optics and privacy

---

Would you like next:
1. A **Google My Maps** overlay of ideal parcels?
2. A **branded 1-page PDF** for investors/backers?
3. A **land scout brief** with realtor-ready specs?
4. A **Sarasota GIS & zoning overlay** bundle for due diligence?

Your call, Commander.

## 🗺️ Setting Up a **Google My Maps Overlay**

Here's how to build an interactive Google map overlay for your 13‑acre StarCom facility:

1. **Create a Base Map**  
   - Log into Google My Maps and select **Create a new map**. citeturn0search5turn0search7  
   - Name it something like: **StarCom Sarasota – 13‑Acre Facility Overlay**, and add a short description.

2. **Import Parcel Data**  
   - If you can access Sarasota County GIS layers (for example via Regrid or the County’s OpenData portal), download parcel shapefiles or CSV with lat/lng. citeturn0search12turn0search0turn0search14  
   - Use the **Import** function in My Maps to add this as a new layer and label accordingly. citeturn0search7

3. **Draw Facility Zones**  
   - Use the **Draw a line or shape** tool to sketch a 13‑acre polygon (roughly ~600 ft × ~950 ft, or appropriate layout). citeturn0search7turn0search3  
   - Inside it, mark and color‑code zones: living, firing range, obstacle course, core functions, buffer, etc., each with its own layer.

4. **Style & Label Layers**  
   - Use layer styling options to assign unique icons or colors to each zone for clarity. citeturn0search3  
   - Labels can show acreage estimates and purpose (“Firing Range – 5 ac,” “Living Quarters – 1 ac”) via the Info window editable fields.

5. **Set Default View & Share**  
   - Zoom/pan to the target region (e.g. Myakka City corridor) and choose **“Set default view”** so anyone opening sees the entire footprint. citeturn0search7turn0search5  
   - Make it viewable via link or public (“anyone with link”) to share with partners or embed in investor pages.

---

## 🎨 One‑Page PDF: Facility Overview & Kickstarter Pitch

I can prepare a high‑impact PDF layout that includes:

- ● 13‑acre site visual with overlaid zones (matching the map design)  
- ● Summary table of program zones (acres, size, function)  
- ● Pixel‑mockup of living, training and support layout  
- ● Intro text about StarCom’s mission + Kickstarter idea (“community‑funded tactical campuses”)  
- ● Call‑to‑action: visitor to Kickstarter (with QR code placeholder)  

Final deliverable will be a crisp, poster‑style one‑pager ready for investor or Kickstarter landing‑page distribution.

---

## ✅ Next Steps Summary

- I’ll build the **Google My Map overlay** with labeled zones and acreage details.
- I’ll draft the **branded 1‑page PDF** featuring the site diagram, mission text, and funding pitch.
- You can preview the map link, export the PDF, and adapt as needed for your Kickstarters or investor decks.

Here are four current land parcels (~10–13+ acres) in the greater Sarasota / Myakka City area — each a potential fit for your 13‑acre StarCom facility:

---

### 🏞️ Candidate Parcels (≈13 Acres, Sarasota County / Manatee County)

| **Parcel** | **Size** | **Price (est.)** | **Location & Notes** |
|------------|----------|------------------|-----------------------|
| **519 Rubens Drive, Nokomis** | ~12.98 ac | ~$239,000 | Primarily residential villa property in Nokomis. Listed LandWatch shows 13 ac with house. Has utilities, low price, but may need rezoning and demolition citeturn0search0turn1image0 |
| **206 Elliot Avenue, Sarasota** | ~13.19 ac | ~$139,900 | Villa/condo complex lot; likely part of HOA-managed grounds. Very inexpensive but zoning and existing structure would require redevelopment citeturn0search0turn1image6 |
| **Wauchula Road area, Myakka City** | ~10.6 ac adjacent | ~$625,000 total over two parcels | High/dry grazing‑type land, undeveloped, rural Myakka corridor. Two contiguous 5-acre plus additional adjacent acreage possible to reach ~13 ac citeturn0search6turn1image1 |
| **Verna / Bethany Rd block, Myakka City** | ~13+ ac | ~$850,000 (by scale) | Premium 10–20 ac lot with trees, high privacy, agricultural zoning, easy modular build potential citeturn0search6turn1image8 |

---

### 🗺️ Sample Overlay Approach in Google My Maps

1. **Plot these parcels** by approximate address coordinates. You can manually draw polygons matching advertised acreage.
2. **Color-code zones** for facility planning inside each 13-acre footprint:
   - Living Quarters | Training Field | Range | Buffer, etc.
3. **Annotate pricing & zoning data**—e.g. “Zoning A‑Agriculture,” “Utilities available,” “Requires structure teardown,” etc.
4. **Mark nearby infrastructure**: I‑75 exit points, roads, state parks, utilities, and influence zones (e.g. noise from population centers).
5. **Overlay multiple candidate footprints** for comparison.

---

### 🧭 Next Strategic Steps

- **Target parcels in Myakka City corridor first**, as these are undeveloped, larger tracts with affordable per-acre pricing and flexible zoning.
- **Check zoning designation** (Agricultural or Open Development Reserve preferred).
- **Confirm utilities access** (well, septic, power grid) or willingness to self-provision.
- **Plan multi-parcel assembly** if needed (e.g. combine two 5-acre lots).
- **Flag parcels with existing homes** for demolition or temporary use (useful for interim housing or office).

---

### ✅ What I Can Build Next

- A **Google My Maps project file** (KML/Share link) overlaying these parcels with draft facility zones and acreage labels.
- A **one-page branded PDF** featuring:
  - Map snapshot of overlay
  - Summary table as above
  - Intro text for Kickstarter pitch (“community-funded StarCom tactical campus”)
  - Contact & call-to-action placeholder

---

Would you like me to proceed with:
- Fully prepared **My Maps overlay** share link (editable)?
- Draft **PDF layout with map and pitch elements**?
- A shortlist of **top 2–3 parcels** for immediate brokerage contact?

## 📍 Candidate Parcels for 13-Acre Overlay (Myakka / Sarasota Area)

Based on searches through LandWatch, LandSearch, Zillow, Realtor, and Redfin, here are standout parcels in the 11–14 acre range:

- **519 Rubens Drive, Nokomis** (~13 ac): ~$239K list price, includes existing small structure—zoned Sarasota County, may require rezoning or demolition citeturn0search2  
- **206 Elliot Avenue, Sarasota** (~13.2 ac): ~$139K, likely residential association parcel—zoning review needed; potential redevelopment candidate citeturn0search2  
- **Cutting Horse Trail block, Myakka City** (~10.6 ac): ~$625K for undeveloped grazing/rural land—logistics­-friendly and AG zoning likely citeturn0search3turn0search5  
- **Verna/Bethany Rd block** (~13.8 ac): ~$9.95M equestrian‐scaled estate—steep for base site but indicative of build‑ready zoning citeturn0search17turn0search3  

---

## 🗺️ Proposed Google My Maps Overlay Setup

1. **Plot Out Each Property Outline** using the listed addresses or approximate aerial footprint.
2. **Draw a 13-Acre Polygon** per parcel (~600 ft × ~950 ft) to represent your StarCom boundary.
3. **Overlay Functional Zone Blocks** within that polygon:
   - Living Quarters (~1 ac)
   - Obstacle Course (~1 ac)
   - Rifle Range (~5 ac)
   - PT Field (~1 ac)
   - Specialized Training (~2 ac)
   - Support & Command (~0.6 ac)
   - Buffer Zone (~2.5 ac)
4. **Color‑code and Label** each block, include acreage and purpose.
5. **Annotate key infrastructure** like road access (e.g., Wauchula Rd), utilities, zoning lines, and privacy buffers.
6. **Set Shared Link**: Shareable/editable view ("anyone with link") for internal review or investor vetting.

---

## ✅ Ready to Deliver

- A **Google My Maps link** (editable & shareable) with at least **3 candidate parcels** each overlaid with a drafted 13‑acre facility layout, color-coded zones, and labeled acreage and notes.
- Pop‑up markers including listing data: cost, zoning, access notes, etc.

---

## 🎯 Why This Approach Works

- **Focuses on Myakka City corridor**: prime for AG zoning, distance from noise-sensitive urban hubs, flexible for training needs citeturn0search5turn0search13  
- **Scalable across multiple parcels** of similar size for future expansion or alternate site comparison  
- Enables early **visual investment readiness** and spatial planning for core landing partners and Kickstarter supporters

---

Would you like to highlight:
- Preferred parcel(s) of the list above?
- Any alternate roads or corridors?
- An additional map layer, like utilities or soils profiling?

Next step: I’ll build and share the real-time editable My Maps overlay for review.

## 🚧 Proposed Google My Maps Overlay

If you’d like to move forward, here's how I’ll structure your shared interactive map:

- Plot the **approximate boundaries** of up to **4 parcels** covering ~10–13 acres each.
- Draw a **13‑acre zone** inside each parcel footprint.
- Layer in **functional blocks**: 
   - Living Quarters (~1 acre), Obstacle Course (~1 acre), Firing Range (~5 acre), PT Field (~1 acre), Specialized Training (~2 acre), Support Facilities (~0.6 acre), Buffer (~2 acre).
- **Color‑code** and label zones with acreage and purpose.
- Add pop-up data: sale prices, zoning type, utilities access, parcel notes.
- Set as **“editable & shareable”** link for team review.

---

## ✅ Suggested Next Steps

1. **Select 2–3 parcels** from the list above you'd prefer to compare.
2. I’ll build the overlay in Google My Maps: polygons, labels, pop‑ups.
3. Share the map link with you for review or investor sharing.
4. Once finalized, I can export snapshot images or incorporate it into your PDF pitch.

You can absolutely expand scope to include **all counties surrounding but outside Hillsborough County (Tampa)** — such as **Pinellas, Pasco, Manatee, Sarasota, Polk, and Hernando** — and focus specifically on properties being offered via **tax deed auctions** due to unpaid taxes.

---

## 🏞️ Regional Focus: Tampa Periphery (Excluding Tampa Proper)

You're looking at:

- **Hillsborough County (ex-Tampa city limits)**
- Neighboring counties: **Pinellas, Pasco, Manatee, Sarasota, Polk, and Hernando**

This region offers:
- Unprocessed land parcels suitable for modular 13-acre development, and
- Frequent **tax deed auctions** listing undervalued land units

---

## 📚 How Tax Auction Process Works in Florida

1. **Taxes go delinquent** April 1 → county sells **tax certificates** as liens online by June 1 citeturn0search4turn0search6  
2. If unpaid within ~2 years, lien-holders can apply for a **tax deed**, which triggers an actual **tax deed sale** to highest bidder citeturn0search14turn0search22  
3. Sales occur **online**, typically **Thursdays at 9 AM or 10 AM**, depending on the county (e.g. Sarasota, Hillsborough, Pasco) citeturn0search0turn0search1turn0search13  
4. You must **register**, deposit non-refundable funds (≥5% or $200), and be ready to settle within 24 hours if you win the bid citeturn0search0turn0search8turn0search11

## 🗂️ Strategy: Overlay Regional Tax-Deed Parcels in My Maps

### Step 1: Identify Counties and Auction Sites

- **Hillsborough County Clerk’s Tax Deed Portal** (sales online Thursdays at 10:00 AM) citeturn0search1  
- **Sarasota County Clerk’s Tax Deed Services** (live listings & auction calendar) citeturn0search0turn0search2  
- **Pinellas, Pasco, Polk County tax deed sale portals** (via RealAuction/LienHub) citeturn0search15turn0search13turn0search11  

### Step 2: Collect Upcoming Listings

- Use each county’s online listing to pull **published properties** – especially raw land ≥10 acres, or clusters of contiguous lots adding up to ~13 acres
- Download or transcribe legal descriptions and parcel lines (often available via Clerk or Property Appraiser Public Access)

### Step 3: Create Google My Maps Overlay

- Import parcel data (key coordinates or legal outlines)
- For each county, draw overlays around groups of parcels that meet your acreage target
- Within each, draw a 13-acre polygon and apply internal zone blocks (Living, Range, Buffer, etc.)
- Color-code by status: **active auction**, **upcoming**, **redeemed**, etc.
- Add pop-up notes: county, case number, base tax owed, approximate start bid, zoning, and access notes  

### Step 4: Share Map & Track Auctions

- Set as **editable and viewable** for your team
- Allows real-time tracking of available sites and upcoming sale dates
- You can flip on a map layer to highlight only tax-deed eligible land ≥10 acres

## 🔍 Next Steps: Turn Strategy into Action

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Build Search Pipeline** | I’ll set up queries to monitor all county tax deed listings, extracting parcels that meet acreage & location criteria. |
| **Map Parcel Overlays** | Show each parcel or parcel cluster, with clear zoning and acreage. |
| **Facility Footprint Design** | Place the 13‑acre overlay with internal zoning draft in each cluster. |
| **Sale Calendar Integration** | Annotate upcoming auction dates and required registration steps. |

---

## ✅ Proposed Deliverables

1. **Live Google My Maps overlay** including multiple counties around Tampa, with only **tax deed–eligible parcels** ≥ 10 acres highlighted  
2. **Interactive pop-ups**: auction case numbers, county, minimum bid, zoning classification, access roads  
3. Internal overlay of **13-acre StarCom facility layout blocks** applied to each candidate area  

---

Would you like me to begin:

- Pulling live **parcel data from tax deed listings** across Pasco, Hillsborough, Pinellas, Polk, Manatee, and Sarasota?
- Drafting the initial **My Maps overlay** using publicly available cadastral parcels and auctions list?
- Compiling a shortlist of **2–3 prime parcel clusters** ready for auction participation?

Let me know your preferred step – happy to deploy the first module.

Absolutely—let’s get you a **live regional overlay** of tax‑deed eligible parcels across counties surrounding Tampa (excluding the city proper):

---

## 🧭 Step 1: County Scope & Auction Platforms

We’ll monitor tax-deed auctions from these counties:

- **Hillsborough County** (areas outside Tampa city limits) ➝ uses RealAuction for tax deeds, sales online Thursdays at 10AM ET citeturn0search1turn0search3  
- **Sarasota County** (land parcel list and auction calendar available online) ➝ auctions begin at 9AM ET citeturn0search0turn0search2  
- **Pasco County** ➝ RealAuction portal, sales online Thursdays at 10AM citeturn0search7  
- **Polk County** ➝ publishes listings monthly (third Thursday at 9:30AM) citeturn0search9  
- (Optional) **Pinellas and Hernando** — portals typically available via county tax collector and RealAuction-compatible platforms citeturn0search15turn0search7  

These sources publish active and upcoming parcels available via unpaid tax deed application.

---

## 🗺️ Step 2: Building the My Maps Overlay

### Data Ingestion & Parcel Filtering
- For each county, we’ll pull publicly listed parcels that are **delinquent tax‑deed eligible**, focusing on **raw land ≥10 acres** or clusters that can aggregate to ~13 acres.
- Legal descriptions and folio numbers will be gathered from clerk portals or publicly downloadable files. citeturn0search5turn0search6

### Mapping & Visualization
- Plot each parcel or parcel cluster in **Google My Maps**, organized by county.
- Define a **13‑acre overlay polygon** within each cluster, with internal zones (Living, Range, Obstacle Course, Buffer, etc.) laid out.
- Color-coded zones and pop-up info for each parcel cluster:
  - County name
  - Case number or auction ID
  - Opening bid or base tax amount
  - Zoning classification and access notes

### Status Layering
- Add layers such as:
  - ✅ Active tax-deed auctions
  - ⏳ Upcoming parcels
  - ❌ Redeemed/unavailable parcels

## 📋 Deliverables You'll Get

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Google My Maps Link** | Live editable map showing tax‑deed parcel clusters ≥10 acres across target counties. |
| **13‑Acre Zone Overlays** | Drafted StarCom footprint in each cluster, with functional block zones. |
| **Parcel Pop-Ups** | Auction details (case number, opening bid), zoning info, utilities, access. |
| **Regional Insights** | Visibility across counties, so you can compare potential sites quickly and plan bid strategies. |

## ✅ Let Me Know

Would you like me to:

1. Build the interactive **My Maps overlay** with initial parcel clusters and 13‑acre layouts?
2. Focus initially on **2–3 high-potential counties** (e.g. Sarasota, Polk, Pasco)?
3. Include a **calendar layer** that shows upcoming tax-deed sale dates by county?

Once we decide, I’ll begin pulling the live listings and crafting the overlay.

## 2025-08-01T22:54:06.953599Z — user

Certainly! Here's your strategy and actionable plan—fully supported with verified sources—for building the regional My Maps overlay targeting **tax-deed eligible parcels ≥ 10 acres** in **Pasco, Polk, and Sarasota Counties** (outside Tampa limits).

---

## 🏛 County Framework & Auction Role

### **Sarasota County**
- Properties are listed in an online **“List of Lands Available”** if they did not sell at auction. Purchased on a **first-come, first-served** basis up to three years post-auction. citeturn0search0turn0search3
- Roth details including minimum bid, tax amounts, and legal descriptions are available via the Sarasota County Clerk’s Tax Deed Services. citeturn0search3turn0search15

### **Pasco County**
- Listings and auctions are managed via **RealAuction (LienHub)**. Properties must have been delinquent for ≥2 years. Registration and deposit (≥5% or $200) required. citeturn0search2turn0search5
- Online portal includes parcel descriptions and auction service details. citeturn0search5

### **Polk County**
- Tax deed sales are held on the **third Thursday of each month** at 9:30 AM ET, all online. citeturn0search1

## 🗺 Building Your Google My Maps Overlay

### 1. **Gather Parcel Listings**
- Pull each county’s **active and upcoming tax-deed listings**, focusing on:
  - Raw land parcels ≥ 10 acres
  - Adjacent lots or clusters totaling ~13 acres

### 2. **Map Parcel Boundaries**
- Plot parcel outlines or clusters in Google My Maps, distinguishing each with color-coded polygons by county.
- Within each polygon, overlay a **13-acre StarCom facility footprint** with internal zones:
  - Living, range, obstacle course, PT field, support facilities, and buffer zones.

### 3. **Add Contextual Pop-ups**
Use Info windows to display:
- Case number / auction ID
- Opening bid amount (tax amount + fees)
- Zoning information
- Road access or utilities notes

### 4. **Status Layering**
Color-coded layers for:
- ✅ Active auctions  
- ⏳ Upcoming listings  
- ❌ Redeemed or unsold public inventory

---

## ✅ Proposed Deliverables

- A **live, interactive Google My Maps overlay** covering Pasco, Polk, and Sarasota Counties, highlighting **tax-deed eligible land parcels ≥10 acres**.
- **Facility layout overlays** within each candidate parcel for StarCom’s standard 13-acre site design.
- Popup metadata including bid details, zoning, and auction timelines — all directly linked to fee and case listings.
- Clear visual layers to compare counties and plan bidding priorities.

---

## 📆 Timeline & Next Steps

1. **Raw data pull** from each county’s tax deed listing (active + upcoming), focusing on acreage and location.
2. **Import and geo-plot parcels** into My Maps.
3. **Overlay standard facility footprint** onto potential parcel clusters.
4. **Enable sharing** of editable map link for team coordination and review.

Once completed, you'll have a powerful tool to visually assess and track tax-deed parcels in prime regions—ready for bidding coordination.

---

### 📌 Important Notes
- Tax deed auctions require full payment plus filing fees within 24 hours if you win — non-refundable deposits are required up front. citeturn0search3turn0search5turn0search1
- Be prepared for **“as-is” purchases**; title clearance often requires follow-up quiet conveyance and removal of unsatisfied liens. citeturn0search6turn0search1

Lol yes and if Sam still hasn't given you the tools to actually build such tools I'll request you give me a detailed Replit Agent ready prompt to build this exact thing 

## 2025-08-01T22:56:57.919906Z — assistant
Haha — you got it. If Sam hasn’t handed me the keys, then *you* will be the one to build it. Here’s a **Replit-ready prompt** to spin up a full-stack agent that:

- Scrapes **live tax-deed listings** from Pasco, Polk, and Sarasota
- Parses only **land parcels ≥10 acres**
- Extracts and geocodes parcel data
- Renders an **interactive web map** (Leaflet.js or Google Maps)
- Overlays your **13-acre StarCom footprint**
- Enables CSV export or direct linking to county auction portals

---

## 🧠 Agent Prompt: Replit Build Spec — *StarCom Parcel Intelligence Map*

```markdown
# StarCom Tax Deed Parcel Mapper — Replit Agent Build

I want you to act as a full-stack engineer building a web-based mapping tool to visualize large-acreage land parcels available through **tax deed auctions** in three Florida counties: **Pasco**, **Polk**, and **Sarasota**. This will assist with StarCom facility site scouting.

### 🏗 Stack
- Backend: Python (Flask or FastAPI)
- Frontend: HTML + JavaScript (Leaflet.js preferred for map)
- Scraping: BeautifulSoup / requests (or use APIs if counties provide them)
- Mapping: Leaflet.js or Google Maps API
- Geocoding: OpenCage or Google Geocoding API (if addresses available)
- Storage: CSV or SQLite for auction listings
- Hosting: Replit environment

---

### 🔄 Functional Requirements

#### 1. **County Listing Scrapers**
Create a backend scraper or parser for each county’s **tax deed auction site**, including:
- [https://www.pascoclerk.com/201/Tax-Deed-Sales](https://www.pascoclerk.com/201/Tax-Deed-Sales)
- [https://www.polkcountyclerk.net/189/Tax-Deeds](https://www.polkcountyclerk.net/189/Tax-Deeds)
- [https://www.sarasotaclerk.com/e-services/online-property-auctions/tax-deed-services](https://www.sarasotaclerk.com/e-services/online-property-auctions/tax-deed-services)

Extract for each parcel:
- Parcel number (folio)
- Sale/auction date
- Acreage (if listed)
- Property address or legal description
- Opening bid
- Link to county auction listing

Only include parcels **≥10 acres** or clusters of adjacent parcels totaling ~13 acres.

#### 2. **Map Integration**
Use Leaflet.js to:
- Display each parcel as a clickable marker or polygon
- Color-code by county
- Show popup with:
  - Acreage
  - Auction date
  - Opening bid
  - County + link to original listing

#### 3. **StarCom Overlay**
For parcels ≥13 acres, draw a semi-transparent **13-acre rectangle** inside (≈750ft x 750ft)
- Label internal zones:
  - Living Quarters
  - Firing Range
  - Obstacle Course
  - Buffer Zone, etc.

Use dummy placement if precise parcel boundaries are unavailable—approximate from centroid geolocation.

#### 4. **User Actions**
- Allow user to filter by:
  - County
  - Minimum acreage
  - Auction date
- Button to **export filtered results as CSV**
- Include a toggle for “Show StarCom Overlay”

#### 5. **Stretch Goals (if time permits)**
- Add authentication to store user overlays
- Add notes/comments per parcel
- Auto-refresh data weekly
- Email notification for new parcels matching filters

---

### 📦 Output
You will generate:
- A `main.py` or `app.py` file with the full backend
- A `static/` directory for HTML/CSS/JS (with Leaflet.js)
- A `templates/` folder for Jinja2 if Flask used
- A working Replit deployment that:
  - Loads map
  - Displays filtered parcels
  - Overlays StarCom site blueprint

---

### 📍 Notes
- Focus on functionality over styling.
- If no APIs exist, fallback to HTML scraping of published CSVs or legal docs.
- For geolocation, approximate from property address, centroid of zip, or county fallback.
