18:30 to 05:00 is my schedule today

That's 6:30pm correct?

## 2025-08-24T15:54:04.624230Z — assistant
Yes, exactly 👍  

- **18:30** = **6:30 PM** (today evening)  
- **05:00** = **5:00 AM** (tomorrow morning)  

So your schedule runs **6:30 PM tonight → 5:00 AM tomorrow** — a **10.5-hour shift**.  

Do you want me to also break down what time your breaks might fall in that window?
