You're interacting with the T-Mobile for Business (tfb.t-mobile.com) dashboard, and here’s what each image is showing — along with how to activate cellular service on your tablet:

---

### 🧾 **Image 1: EIP Make Additional Pay**
This is a **warning** about **Equipment Installment Plan (EIP) promotions**. If your tablet or device has a monthly credit promotion that started on or after **July 1, 2024**, then:

- **Making a partial payment** will reduce your monthly credits.
- **Paying it off completely** will **end** the promotional credits.
  
⚠️ **What to do?**
If you rely on a monthly bill credit (e.g. a “free device” promotion), don’t pay off the device early unless you're okay with losing that credit.

---

### 🔄 **Image 2: How to Trade In Your Old Device**
This is a T-Mobile trade-in process guide:
1. **Add or upgrade a line** on your account via the "Shop" tab.
2. You’ll be prompted to **send in your old device** (they’ll ship you a trade-in kit).
3. **Credit is applied** to your bill after evaluation (within 2–3 billing cycles).

📌 Note: If you're trying to activate a tablet with cellular, the trade-in step is **optional**, and only needed if you're leveraging a promo.

---

### 📁 **Image 3: Restore Lines**
This relates to **restoring suspended/cancelled lines** via bulk action. It offers an **XLS or CSV upload** for larger accounts (like if you're managing multiple devices for a business).

---

### 📲 **How to Activate Cellular on Your Tablet**
Here’s a simple walkthrough:

#### **Option 1: New Line Activation for Tablet**
1. Go to [https://tfb.t-mobile.com](https://tfb.t-mobile.com) and log into your account.
2. Navigate to:
   - **Shop > Tablets** or **Add a Line**
3. Choose your tablet or BYOD (Bring Your Own Device).
4. Select a **data plan** (some are tablet-specific).
5. Complete checkout and wait for **SIM or eSIM activation instructions**.
6. If using **eSIM**, go to your tablet’s:
   - `Settings > Cellular > Add Cellular Plan`
   - Then **scan the QR code** T-Mobile gives you or enter the SM-DP+ address.

#### **Option 2: Use Existing Line/SIM**
If you have a spare SIM:
1. Insert the SIM into your tablet.
2. Restart the device.
3. Go to:
   - `Settings > Cellular Data > Turn On`
4. You should see **T-Mobile LTE/5G** appear.

### 🛠 Want Me to Walk You Through Activation Live?
If you upload a picture of your tablet’s settings screen (e.g., `Settings > About` or `Settings > Cellular`), I can guide you step-by-step based on the device type (iPad, Samsung Galaxy Tab, etc.).

Also helpful:
- Is it **Wi-Fi + Cellular** or just Wi-Fi?
- Do you already have a SIM or need to activate a new line/eSIM?

Let me know what you’re working with and I’ll tailor the steps.
