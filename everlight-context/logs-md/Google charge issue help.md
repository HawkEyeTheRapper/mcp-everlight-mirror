That’s alarming, Ethan. A few possibilities and steps you can take immediately:

---

## 🔎 Why This Might Be Happening
1. **Linked through Navy Federal → Google Pay**  
   If you ever added your Navy Federal card to Google Pay (for phone tap-to-pay, Play Store purchases, subscriptions, etc.), Google has access to it, even if you didn’t give it directly to them.

2. **Third-party subscription via Google**  
   Sometimes apps/services you signed up for (YouTube Premium, Google Cloud, storage upgrades, in-app subscriptions) will route billing through Google, which can trigger unexpected charges.

3. **Fraudulent/unauthorized use**  
   If neither of the above applies, your card info may have been compromised and used under your Google account or an impersonated account.

---

## ⚡ Immediate Actions
1. **Check Google Payments**  
   - Go to [pay.google.com](https://pay.google.com/) → **Subscriptions & Services** and **Activity** tabs.  
   - Look for the $100 charge attempt. If it’s not there, it may be fraud outside your account.

2. **Check Navy Federal**  
   - Log into your NFCU app/online → check pending charges.  
   - Dispute or block the transaction immediately if it’s unauthorized.

3. **Remove the card from Google**  
   - If you see your Navy Federal card in Google Pay/Play → remove it ASAP.

4. **Freeze/replace your card**  
   - If you didn’t knowingly add it, call Navy Federal right away to freeze and request a replacement.  
   - They’ll also open a fraud claim.

---

## 🚨 Extra Precautions
- Enable **transaction alerts** in Navy Federal app (push + text).  
- Turn on **Google 2-step verification** so no one can sneak in and add cards.  
- Audit your Google account at [myaccount.google.com/security-checkup](https://myaccount.google.com/security-checkup).

Do you want me to draft you a **step-by-step dispute script** (for NFCU or Google support) so you can lock this down fast?
