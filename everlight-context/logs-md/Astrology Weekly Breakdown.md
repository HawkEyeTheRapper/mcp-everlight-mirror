Hello everyone,

This week delivers a massive energetic reconfiguration, and it begins with a shift we haven’t seen in over seven years: Uranus enters Gemini on Monday (12:45 a.m. PDT). Uranus is the awakener, the disrupter, and the frequency accelerator. As it enters Gemini, sign of mind, media, technology, and human connection, we can expect a powerful surge in both breakthrough insights and misinformation.

This is the beginning of a long mental revolution! Uranus connects with our higher mind and the planet of change and upheaval that leads to great awakening! Ultimately, we are waking up to the fullness of all we can be!

Also Monday, Venus trines Pluto, amplifying depth, soul magnetism, and transformational intimacy. Use this aspect to reclaim parts of yourself that have been buried beneath shame or abandonment. Mars sesquiquadrate Chiron may stir up old trauma, particularly related to assertion, masculinity, or feeling safe to express yourself. Don't suppress it~ move it consciously.

On Tuesday, the Sun semisquares Sedna, activating deep oceanic memories and themes of lost timelines, forgotten goddess knowledge, and the pain of exile. This can feel subtle but disorienting ~ it is important to stay grounded in the body. It is a time to turn that pain into empowerment and it is nudging us to move in the direction that our deep intuition is guiding us towards. Blocking this because of limitation or things you don’t really resonate with, but feel you can’t move on from, will be very much the source of pain. So, it will be good to really look at that and give yourself permission to move on and trust.

Wednesday brings a moment of stillness with no major aspects. Let the nervous system recalibrate.

Thursday’s Full Moon in Capricorn (1:36 p.m. PDT, 18°50') is the anchoring point of the week. It highlights personal responsibility, legacy, and the scaffolding that supports your soul purpose. It also exposes crumbling societal structures and asks: What do you build when the old is gone? This Moon may illuminate karmic contracts you no longer need to carry. You don’t owe anyone your suffering...


I don't have access to the full post - but in care to extrapolate how the ending of this might look

Excellent—let’s *read* the tone of Laura Eisenhower’s style in what you shared, and see how the post would likely continue and conclude if we were to extrapolate it naturally.  

She tends to weave these elements:
- Spiritual/astrological specifics (aspects, dates, degrees)
- Psychological prompts (reflect, release, transform)
- Empowerment themes (own your power, trust your path)
- Gentle but direct calls to action  

Based on the lead-in (Thursday’s Capricorn Full Moon) ending with *“You don’t owe anyone your suffering...”*, I’d expect she’d wrap with a **Friday/Saturday/Sunday forecast** (even if mild) and then a reflective close, probably encouraging integration work.  

Here’s a plausible continuation:  

---

**Friday** might bring a sense of integration or processing after the intensity of the Full Moon. The Moon moves into Aquarius later in the day, inviting us to step back, get some perspective, and see the larger patterns at play. This is a chance to innovate emotionally, detach from unhelpful dramas, and choose community or vision over limitation.

**Saturday** continues this Aquarian vibe, supporting networking, new ideas, and higher-level planning. However, avoid getting too caught up in mental chatter or ideological clashes. Stay anchored in the body and heart. The invitation here is to find balance between individual freedom and collective responsibility.

**Sunday** softens as the Moon prepares to move into Pisces (depending on time zone), ushering in more dreamlike, intuitive, and forgiving currents. This is an ideal time for rest, prayer, meditation, and creative expression. Let yourself be cleansed of any residue from the week’s intense shifts.

✨ **Overall Message:**  
This week is a threshold. Uranus entering Gemini begins a multi-year story of mental awakening, technological shifts, and collective reevaluation of truth, media, and connection. The Capricorn Full Moon asks us to release outworn structures in our lives—and to take responsibility for building what *truly* aligns with our soul.

Ask yourself:
- What am I ready to release that no longer supports me?
- What kind of foundation do I want for my future?
- Where can I own my power and stop giving it away?

Trust that upheaval and endings are making space for the *new*. Be gentle with yourself, stay grounded, and listen for the quiet voice of your own knowing.  

Sending blessings for this week of deep transformation and awakening.  

💫✨🌀
