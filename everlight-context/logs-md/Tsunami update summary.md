- **Aftershocks** ranging up to magnitude ~6.9 have occurred near the epicenter; seismic activity remains carefully monitored citeturn0news20turn0news23.

## 📍 Local (Ashburn / Washington DC area)
- No tsunami threat in your region—tsunami advisories/warnings are only active for **Pacific coastal areas** (from Alaska down through California). Inland areas like DC or Virginia are unaffected.

## ✅ What to do now
- If you're in affected **coastal zones**: **stay off beaches**, heed guidance from National Tsunami Warning Center and local agencies, especially while advisories remain.
- If you're inland: no direct threat—though it's good to stay informed via reliable sources like **tsunami.gov** or NOAA when events like these occur.
