🔥 This structure makes it easy to drop this Spotify playlist chat into `/Soundtrack/Spotify_Playlists.md` as a first artifact.  

Do you want me to also **pre-populate a filled-out template** for one of the songs (*Castle* by Halsey, for example) so you’ve got a working model of how to annotate each track in narrative terms?

Got it ✅  

Your uploaded **First Light.docx** contains the full draft of your novel *First Light* by Ethan Womack.  

Here’s what I’ve confirmed from the text:

### 📖 Structure
- **Prologue** – Halana Vordeaux oversleeps, dreams of the Luminous Halls, then is abducted by Dark Workers. Her role as a “Sun Speaker” and her connection to the DreamState is introduced.  
- **Act One – The First to Awaken**  
  - **Chapter 1 – Harvest Festival** → Introduces Gael Mordrova, Princess Vivianna, and Kalina Dodson. Focus is on Kalina’s sword training and family dynamics.  
  - **Chapter 2 – Royal Duty** → Tension between Kalina and Vivianna; hints at suitors.  
  - **Chapter 3 – The Lord of Korlan** → Kalina meets Seth Haversham of Korlan; their bond as allies (not romantic partners) begins.  
  - **Chapter 4 – The Watcher** → Kalina encounters Friede, who reveals her destiny as “The Warlord of Light.”  
  - **Intermission – Of Those Who Speak** → Switches to Zahara Marshall’s POV; she’s charged by a Dragon to free Halana.  
  - **Chapter 5 – Darkness Invades** → Festival descends into chaos; Dark Workers attack.  
  - **Chapter 6 – First Blood** → Kalina’s first true kill; she barely survives.  
  - **Chapter 7 – Those Awaiting the Return** → Torvan Dochavich carries Kalina to Lauriden.  
  - **Intermission – Yet Have Not Ears** → Zahara confronts the Seat of the Sun Speakers about Halana’s disappearance.  
  - **Chapter 8 – Lauriden** → Kalina awakens in the city of the Elves.  
  - **Chapter 9–11** → Kalina heals, bonds with Diana, and begins learning Forgotten Knowledge.  
- **Act Two – Training a Warlord**  
  - Chapters 12–24 → Gael resumes Kalina’s brutal training; Diana becomes her support; Salazar Kadren attacks Lauriden; Kalina is captured and tortured by Dark Workers.  
  - She acquires the **SoulBlade**, a weapon of catastrophic potential.  
- **Act Three – So It Begins**  
  - Chapters 25–36 (and multiple interludes) → Kalina’s true Awakening, her solitary journey, return to Paravese, confrontation with Queen Vivianna, reunion with Diana, and her departure west to seek “The Teacher.”  
- **Epilogue + Untitled Scene Notes** → Outline of the grand arc tying into Orunibu, The Demons in the Box, and the returning Star Walkers.  

### 🌟 Key Themes
- **DreamState vs. waking reality** – visions guide both Halana and Kalina.  
- **Friendship & loyalty** – Kalina with Diana, Vivianna, Seth, and Gael; Zahara with Halana.  
- **Destiny & burden** – Kalina as the Warlord of Light; Halana as Sun Speaker.  
- **Light vs. Dark** – Star Walkers, Forgotten Knowledge, Orunibu, Demons in the Box.  

### 📝 Extra Notes in Draft
- Extended synopsis and scene notes at the bottom outline your whole saga.  
- Acknowledges **plot holes** (e.g., why Dark Workers don’t just kill Kalina).  
- Specifies **future romance arc** (Kalina + Diana).  
- Multiple interludes balance Halana’s captivity storyline with Kalina’s awakening.

Would you like me to **(a)** make a clean chapter-by-chapter summary for quick reference, **(b)** extract just the *scene notes + synopsis* into a separate outline doc, or **(c)** help tighten the prose of a specific chapter (e.g., Prologue or Harvest Festival) for editing?

Perfect — I’ll go ahead and **pre-populate a template entry for the song “Castle” by Halsey** so you can drop it right into `/Soundtrack/Spotify_Playlists.md`. This way you’ve got a working model for annotating each track in narrative terms.  

---

### 🎵 Song Annotation Template Example  

**Title & Artist:** *Castle* — Halsey  

**Scene / Chapter Placement:**  
- Opening sequence of *The Black Swan Accords* Omniversal Films saga.  
- Diana Swan’s re-entry into her command station after the Shadow has locked her out.  
- She reclaims control of the Armada by hacking through intergalactic security layers, stylus in hand.  

**Narrative Resonance:**  
- Symbolizes Diana’s *return to sovereignty* after exile.  
- The “Castle” is both the Shadow’s throne room (illusion of power) and Diana’s own digital stronghold which she reclaims.  
- The act of *storming the castle* mirrors Hawk Eye’s real-world struggles with 2FA lockouts, reclaiming domains, and routing authority back into his own hands.  

**Mood Tags:**  
- Defiance  
- Sovereignty  
- Revelation  
- Ascension  
- Authority Restored  

**Extra Notes (optional):**  
- Diana’s whimsical whistle of “Hold Me Down” (the track that follows *Castle*) doubles as a tonal re-encryption key, unlocking the physical doors she marked with her stylus.  
- Scene parallels the meta-narrative: hacking back into your own life after being locked out by shadows of control.  

---

Would you like me to **build this same style of annotation for the other four tracks** in your playlist draft (*Everybody Wants to Rule the World*, *Seven Devils*, *Seven Nation Army*, *Make Me Buy a Gun*) so that `/Spotify_Playlists.md` starts off fully populated instead of just templated?
