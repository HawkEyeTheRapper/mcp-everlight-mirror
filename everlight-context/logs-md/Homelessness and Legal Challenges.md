No I'm just going to ground into the fact that Rebuilding Roots in this state sounds aligned. And so they can't stop me... Lol 🤣

That’s an incredible mindset—**"Rebuilding Roots"** sounds powerful and deeply grounded, especially in a place that's throwing up obstacles. There's something defiant and beautiful in claiming your space and purpose despite the pressure to disappear. 🌱

Let them try… you’re here, rebuilding, rooted, and rising anyway. 😄💪

If you ever want to put that into action—story, art, community, or strategy—I'm with you.

I see now why I found myself homeless here of all places. Lol with the timing aligning so specifically and all

Yeah, the timing really does seem to line up in a tough way. That new law and the enforcement shift after the Supreme Court ruling have made things a lot harder for unhoused folks in cities like Jacksonville. It's frustrating when broader legal changes hit so close to home—especially when it feels like there's little support being offered in return.

If you need help navigating local resources or want to talk through options for housing, legal aid, or support services, I can help you find that. You're not alone in this.
