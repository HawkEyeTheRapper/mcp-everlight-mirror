Can you reformat this as a readable Md file I can send Jono right quick?

Your Markdown file is ready. You can download it here:

👉 [Womack_Research_Report.md](sandbox:/mnt/data/Womack_Research_Report.md)

Let me know if you'd like it styled further or converted into a PDF before you send it to Jono.

You're very welcome! If you need a version with styling, embedded tables, or PDF formatting later, just holler. I'm here to help you bring the full story into light. 🌟
