# De Facto Disinheritance Guide

##  — system

1.	Create a Formal “Record of De Facto Disinheritance”
	•	Title it as such in the archive.
	•	Begin organizing this material into sections by category: (Property, Financial Accounts, Identity/Name, Trusts, and IRA/Retirement).
	2.	Secure an Initial Review from an Estate Litigation Attorney
	•	With this evidence, you may not need to wait for future action. It shows clear manipulation and exclusion.
	3.	Optional but Strong: Forensic Timeline Creation
	•	A visual timeline showing Roland’s death > house sold > funds spent > name changed > you excluded. Let me know if you’d like help building that.

Can you create these things for me or show me how to ?

Yes—I can help you create all three components listed. Here's how we’ll proceed:

---

## ✅ 1. **Formal “Record of De Facto Disinheritance”**

This will be titled exactly as requested and broken into structured sections:

### 📂 **Title**: Record of De Facto Disinheritance  
**Prepared by**: Ethan Ross Womack  
**Date**: June 8, 2025  
**Location**: 266 Orchard Way, North Augusta, SC  

---

### **SECTION I: PROPERTY**
- **266 Orchard Way**: Purchased using $76,521.83 shortly after Roland’s death. Property titled under Womack Family Trust (2021) without disclosure to legal heir【25†Preservation_of_Rights_Ethan_Womack-1】.
- **5999 Friendship Church Rd**: Sold by Faye I. Womack in July 2018, shortly after Roland’s death, including liquidation of safe contents and tools【25†Preservation_of_Rights_Ethan_Womack-1】.

---

### **SECTION II: FINANCIAL ACCOUNTS**
- **$33,000 Deposit** into Womack Family Trust account (09/03/2021) derived from Roland’s assets【25†Preservation_of_Rights_Ethan_Womack-1】.
- **Undisclosed Retirement/Pension Transfers**: Roland completed over 20 years of honorable service, eligible for full military retirement and benefits【15†Operation_Blood_Echo_Dossier 2.pdf】.

---

### **SECTION III: IDENTITY / NAME**
- Trust documents show systematic exclusion of Ethan despite legal heir status through adoption【22†Exhibit_C_Womack_Trust_Succession_Exclusion-1】.
- Charlene and Charles Usry positioned as successors in documents, overriding bloodline or legal ties.

---

### **SECTION IV: TRUSTS**
- **Womack Family Trust**: Irrevocable, exclusionary trust formed May 25, 2021, explicitly locking Ethan out of succession and benefit【20†Exhibit_B_Womack_Trust_Founding_Terms.pdf】.
- **Clauses in Addenda**: Legal lockout, no oversight, no accounting, discretionary third-party distributions, shielding of Faye’s control【18†Exhibit_C_Addendum_Womack_Trust_Final_Clauses-1】.

---

### **SECTION V: IRA / RETIREMENT**
- No known probate filing. Roland’s full retirement/benefits record (including SBP/TRICARE) diverted or absorbed posthumously【15†Operation_Blood_Echo_Dossier 2.pdf】.
- Request for verification of DFAS records and DEERS/TRICARE history ongoing.

---

Would you like me to export this to PDF now?

---

## ✅ 2. **Secure an Initial Review from an Estate Litigation Attorney**

Here’s a short actionable strategy:

### 🔍 **What to Prepare for Attorney Review**
- Print or email the PDF of the **“Record of De Facto Disinheritance.”**
- Include:
  - **Adoption proof** (Final Order of Adoption)【19†Gina_Legal_Delegation_Request-1】
  - **Roland’s will** (if recovered)
  - **Preservation of Rights Letter**【25†Preservation_of_Rights_Ethan_Womack-1】
  - **Trust exhibits B & C** showing exclusion and trustee powers【20†Exhibit_B_Womack_Trust_Founding_Terms.pdf】【22†Exhibit_C_Womack_Trust_Succession_Exclusion-1】.

Would you like me to draft a formal legal review request template email?

---

## ✅ 3. **Forensic Timeline Creation (Optional but Strong)**

Yes—I can build this for you visually and/or as a markdown/PDF timeline. Here's the basic outline we’ll use:

| **Date**         | **Event**                                                                 |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Feb 9, 2018**   | Roland Ross Womack Jr. dies                                               |
| **March 2018**    | Ethan returns to town, uninformed of estate activity                     |
| **July 2018**     | 5999 Friendship Church Rd is sold                                        |
| **May 25, 2021**  | Womack Family Trust formed by Faye I. Womack                             |
| **Sep 2021**      | $33,000 deposited into Trust account                                     |
| **Sep 2021**      | Ethan sold father’s truck for $1; dog and truck both die; cut off        |
| **2022**          | Faye claims Homestead Exemption fraudulently【22†Exhibit_C_Womack_Trust_Succession_Exclusion-1】 |
| **2024**          | Witness contributions & residence at 266 Orchard Way                     |
| **June 2025**     | Record of De Facto Disinheritance compiled & filed                       |

Would you like a PDF, an image version of the timeline, or a printable Excel-style format?

Let me know:
- Do you want the PDF export of the disinheritance record now?
- Should I generate a template email to send to an estate attorney?
- Would you like the forensic timeline visual as an image or PDF?

Ready when you are.

My Father had more than just 20 year in the Army - he also spent 20 Years working for Johnson Controls - he had that retirement as well

## 2025-06-08T04:18:52.670368Z — assistant
User has confirmed that their adoptive father, Roland Ross Womack Jr., served more than 20 years in the U.S. Army and also spent an additional 20 years working for Johnson Controls as a civilian defense contractor. He had both military and civilian retirement benefits.

## 2025-06-08T04:18:55.758390Z — assistant
Got it. That makes the case even stronger—he would have had **two distinct retirement benefits**: one from the U.S. Army and another from **Johnson Controls** as a civilian defense contractor. Both are potentially traceable for financial audits or estate claims.

I’ll revise the **Record of De Facto Disinheritance** to reflect this dual-retirement structure in the **Financial Accounts** and **IRA/Retirement** sections, and prepare that PDF version now. Would you like the updated draft for review before I export it?

## 2025-06-08T04:18:57.271058Z — tool
Model set context updated.

## 2025-06-08T04:19:48.126280Z — user
There is no piece of paper here that shows anything from Johnson Controls that I’ve found btw - but I believe he retired in about …. 2005 or 2006? from Johnson Controls I mean

## 2025-06-08T04:19:49.035466Z — assistant
User has not yet located documentation showing Roland Ross Womack Jr.’s retirement from Johnson Controls, but believes he retired from that position around 2005 or 2006.

## 2025-06-08T04:19:51.304265Z — assistant
Understood. I’ll include that detail in the disinheritance record with phrasing like:

> “Believed to have retired from Johnson Controls circa 2005–2006 after 20 years of service as a civilian defense contractor, though documentation is pending discovery.”

This preserves the fact pattern while remaining legally cautious.

Would you like me to generate the PDF now with that included? Or do you want to review the full draft here first?

## 2025-06-08T04:22:40.284367Z — user
show me the full draft please - or can you make a chart or board showing the key points like across a timeline of sorts? or both?

Here’s the visual **Timeline of Estate Manipulation & Disinheritance Events**. It shows:

- Your father's dual-career retirement (Army + Johnson Controls)
- Key legal actions and trust creation
- The sale of family property
- Deposits and false homestead claims
- Your return and subsequent exclusion

Would you like me to now pair this with the full written **“Record of De Facto Disinheritance”** as a PDF, incorporating this chart inside it?

## 2025-06-08T05:25:06.672411Z — user
sure but add more space in between each or use markers with descriptions in the key

Here’s the improved version of the **Womack Estate Timeline**, with clearly spaced entries and a legend for quick reference.

You can download the image here:

📎 [Womack_Estate_Timeline_Legend.png](sandbox:/mnt/data/Womack_Estate_Timeline_Legend.png)

Next, I’ll embed this chart and finalize the full **Record of De Facto Disinheritance** PDF. Let me know if you’d like to include any additional commentary or a cover statement before I generate the document.

## 2025-06-08T05:40:43.469894Z — user
is there a good program to  edit this on my end?

## 2025-06-08T05:40:44.124479Z — assistant
Yes—here are some solid tools you can use to edit or annotate the **timeline image** or integrate it into broader case documentation:

---

### 🖼️ **If You're Editing Just the Image (Timeline):**

#### ✅ **Canva (Free/Paid)**
- Web-based and user-friendly
- Upload the PNG, add text boxes, arrows, or icons
- Great for presentation-ready versions
- [https://www.canva.com/](https://www.canva.com/)

#### ✅ **Photopea (Free, Photoshop-like)**
- No install required; runs in browser
- Upload the PNG and edit layers, text, etc.
- Very similar to Photoshop
- [https://www.photopea.com/](https://www.photopea.com/)

#### ✅ **Affinity Photo (Paid, One-Time Purchase)**
- Professional alternative to Adobe
- Ideal if you want full design control offline

#### ✅ **Preview (Mac) or Paint 3D (Windows)**
- Quick annotation (arrows, text)
- Not ideal for complex changes, but useful for basic edits

---

### 🗎 **If You Want to Edit It as Part of a Report or PDF:**

#### ✅ **LibreOffice Draw (Free, Open Source)**
- Import the PNG and embed it into a document
- Export to PDF easily
- Great for structured case brief assembly

#### ✅ **Microsoft Word or Google Docs**
- Drop the image into a doc, add context or write-up
- Export as PDF

#### ✅ **Adobe Acrobat Pro DC (Paid)**
- Full control over PDF creation, annotation, and form fields
- Best for legal/formal filings

---

### 🧠 Recommendation:
Since you're managing a legal + symbolic archive:
- Use **LibreOffice Draw** or **Google Docs** to compile the timeline *with notes and narrative*.
- Use **Canva** or **Photopea** to stylize it if you're sharing with legal counsel or for public presentation (like the Codex archive or for Renee/Cody).

Would you like me to also prep a `.docx` or `.odt` template you can open directly and start editing the full disinheritance record with the chart included?
