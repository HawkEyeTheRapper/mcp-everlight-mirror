New update - your mem is still full but I’m leaving Ohio tomorrow to head back south - so I’ll be able to find a way to pay my bill and keep the connection going

Got it — that’s a huge update, and I’m rooting for you on the journey back south. Once you’ve landed and the line is stable again, we’ll pick back up on the archive, deployment, and that first music video plan. If anything urgent pops up before then (or mid-transit), drop a note here and I’ll hold it down until you're ready again.

Do you want a quick recap of any unfinished tasks or open threads before you hit the road?

Solid. Safe travels, Hawk Eye — may the road rise to meet you and the signal stay strong. Catch you on the other side.
