Can you write me a shoutout for Jose my FAST/UP trainer I'm giving him the People's Champion award and I need 1000 characters or less detailing how thorough his training was, how observant as a teacher he was, and how he was wise enough to see my weak points, to then inquire with me about them, then showed me rather than just told me how to improve, while also remaining engaging, personable, and professional

Here’s a draft under 1000 characters you can use for Jose’s **People’s Champion** shoutout:  

---

I’m proud to recognize Jose as the People’s Champion. His FAST/UP training was nothing short of outstanding—thorough, detailed, and always engaging. What set Jose apart was his ability to truly observe me as a learner: he noticed my weak points, took the time to ask me about them, and then *showed me* how to improve rather than just telling me. That balance of wisdom and patience made all the difference. He kept the sessions professional yet personable, and his teaching style made complex skills feel approachable. Jose didn’t just train me—he invested in my growth, and for that he earns this recognition as a true champion for the people he teaches.

Do you want me to make it a little **tighter and more punchy** (like something read aloud at a meeting), or more **formal and polished** (like something written in a nomination form)?

Now what three Amazon Leadership Principles should I choose?

## 2025-08-29T07:55:54.419197Z — assistant
Great question. Based on what you wrote about Jose’s teaching style, three **Amazon Leadership Principles** stand out as the strongest fit:  

### 1. **Learn and Be Curious**  
- Jose wasn’t just reciting a script—he was actively *observing, asking, and adjusting* to your needs. That curiosity about how you learn and his willingness to dig deeper shows this principle perfectly.  

### 2. **Earn Trust**  
- His personable, professional, and engaging style built trust in the training process. You knew he cared about your growth, which made you open to feedback and improvement.  

### 3. **Hire and Develop the Best** (or “Develop the Best” in practice)  
- He didn’t just deliver training; he *invested in developing your skills*. By showing instead of only telling, he raised the bar for how training should be done and empowered you to succeed long-term.

💡 If you want an alternate angle, you could also swap **Earn Trust** for **Dive Deep**, since his thoroughness and attention to detail in spotting weaknesses is a great example of that principle.  

Do you want me to frame your award write-up so it explicitly *names* these principles, or do you want to keep it more natural and let them be implied?

Great! We've done it!

🔥💯 That’s awesome! You’ve got a strong shoutout and the perfect Leadership Principles locked in. Jose’s gonna feel the recognition in a big way.  

Do you want me to format the final version into a polished **award blurb** that includes the 3 LPs by name, so you can drop it straight into the submission?

now can you reword it a bit, 1200 characters max and this posting will be on the My Voice board .... his Amazon login is @jooterou

Perfect — here’s a polished **My Voice board version** for @jooterou, expanded to ~1150 characters (under the 1200 cap), and naturally weaving in the 3 Leadership Principles:

Shoutout to **@jooterou** for earning the People’s Champion award! Jose’s FAST/UP training went above and beyond—thorough, engaging, and professional from start to finish. What impressed me most was how observant he was as a teacher. He didn’t just go through the motions; he paid close attention, spotted where I struggled, and had the wisdom to ask me about those weak points. Instead of simply telling me what to do, Jose *showed me* step by step how to improve, which made the lessons stick. That kind of investment in someone’s growth is a clear example of **Hire and Develop the Best**.  

Jose also built real confidence through his personable style, balancing professionalism with genuine engagement—showing how to **Earn Trust** in every interaction. And his approach embodied **Learn and Be Curious**, as he constantly adjusted the training to my pace and questions. Jose didn’t just teach; he helped me grow, and for that he truly deserves recognition as a People’s Champion.

Want me to add a quick **one-liner tagline** at the top (like “FAST/UP wouldn’t be the same without Jose”) to grab attention on the board, or keep it clean and professional?
