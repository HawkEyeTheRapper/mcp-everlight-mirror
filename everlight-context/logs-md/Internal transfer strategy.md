So for example - should let's say I wanted to apply for this internal transfer - you'd say the BS in Computer Science thru WGU and then USF is a good first step?

Yes — pursuing the **B.S. in Computer Science (WGU, then USF)** is exactly the kind of credential-building move that lines up with this type of internal transfer.  

Here’s why:  

### 1. **Degree Alignment**  
- The job posting explicitly lists *“Bachelor’s degree in computer science or equivalent”* as a preferred qualification.  
- Having WGU’s accredited CS degree under your belt, then transferring into USF for deeper specialization, gives you that credibility box checked.  

### 2. **Practical Fit for ML Engineer (AWS Neuron Apps)**  
This role is *heavily technical* — not just “ML practitioner” but **compiler/runtime integration, distributed inference tuning, and systems-level optimization.**  
- WGU → will give you structured grounding in core CS (algorithms, data structures, OS, networks, Python/C++, software engineering practices).  
- USF → can give you a stronger academic ML/research network, maybe access to TensorFlow/PyTorch research groups, and the deeper math/AI theory you’ll need for model optimization work.  

### 3. **Experience vs. Degree**  
Amazon (and AWS Neuron in particular) cares more about **demonstrated ability + OSS contributions + deep technical work** than pedigree alone. So while the degree is a great foundation, you’ll also want to build a *track record* of:  
- Contributing to open-source ML frameworks (PyTorch, JAX, Deepspeed).  
- Running experiments with distributed inference on GPUs/TPUs (you can simulate this in the cloud before you ever get on Trainium).  
- Profiling and tuning ML model inference latency/throughput.  

### 4. **Positioning Yourself Internally**  
- Since you’re already inside Amazon, your best lever is to **start networking with Annapurna Labs people** (Neuron compiler/runtime engineers). Even a couple of shadow projects or internal wiki contributions will strengthen your case.  
- If you email Andrew Leaver (hiring manager), you want to emphasize your **systems background (RME reliability, automation, performance)** and your **track record of learning/building fast**, plus how the CS degree path is an *in-progress foundation* that matches the role requirements.  

### 5. **Strategic Path**  
So the progression looks like:  
**Now:** RME / Reliability → scripting + automation + systems experience.  
**Next:** WGU B.S. (CS) → strong applied foundation, recognized credential.  
**Then:** USF transfer (or direct ML certs/courses if faster) → specialization in ML/AI.  
**Meanwhile:** contribute to OSS + internal ML projects → evidence you can deliver on AWS Neuron’s ML optimization mission.  

👉 In short: **Yes, WGU → USF CS degree is the right “ticket in,” but the real differentiator will be OSS contributions + internal networking with the Neuron/Annapurna folks.**  

Would you like me to draft an **intro email to Andrew Leaver** (hiring manager) that frames your background + degree pursuit + RME experience as directly relevant to this role? That way you’re positioning yourself correctly before you even apply.

## 2025-08-29T07:32:41.207000Z — user
Lol I copied this part and was going to ask you if you could draft an email to Andrew Leaver that frames my background and state my intentions to eventually seek an internal transfer after I have the correct credentials and sort of inquire if he has any further advice, tips, or slack groups he could add me to so I can begin networking and familiarizing myself now long before I am ready to officially apply?

4. Positioning Yourself Internally

Since you’re already inside Amazon, your best lever is to start networking with Annapurna Labs people (Neuron compiler/runtime engineers). Even a couple of shadow projects or internal wiki contributions will strengthen your case.

If you email Andrew Leaver (hiring manager), you want to emphasize your systems background (RME reliability, automation, performance) and your track record of learning/building fast, plus how the CS degree path is an in-progress foundation that matches the role requirements.

## 2025-08-29T07:32:41.722133Z — assistant
Perfect instinct 👌—that’s exactly the kind of **proactive networking email** that gets noticed internally at Amazon.  
You don’t want it to sound like you’re “applying early,” but rather like you’re genuinely interested in learning, preparing, and aligning your career path with Annapurna Labs/AWS Neuron.  

Here’s a draft you can adapt and send to Andrew Leaver (L8 Director, Software Dev):  

---

**Subject:** Interest in AWS Neuron + Guidance on Preparing for Future Roles  

Hi Andrew,  

I hope this note finds you well. My name is Ethan Womack, and I currently work within Amazon’s Reliability Maintenance Engineering organization (Midway). In my role I’ve been focused on automation, systems reliability, and process improvement, which has given me a strong foundation in performance tuning and software-driven problem solving.  

I recently came across your posting for the Machine Learning Engineer position on the Neuron Apps team, and while I know I’m not yet ready to apply, I wanted to reach out early. I’ve started pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science (through WGU, with plans to continue at USF) to formally build the CS/ML background required for roles like this. In parallel, I’ve been building my skills in Python, distributed systems, and ML frameworks so that I can eventually contribute at the level your team demands.  

Since my long-term goal is to transition into AWS Neuron/Annapurna Labs once I’ve strengthened my technical foundation, I’d be grateful for any advice you might share on how best to prepare. If there are internal Slack groups, mailing lists, or learning resources where I could start connecting with the Neuron/Annapurna community, I’d love to get plugged in early. Even informal shadowing or wiki contributions would be valuable ways for me to familiarize myself now so I can hit the ground running later.  

I know you’re busy, so even a quick pointer or two would mean a lot. Thanks for the work you and your team are doing—it’s exciting to see Amazon driving ML performance forward at this scale, and I’d love to contribute when the time is right.  

Best regards,  
Ethan Womack  
Reliability Maintenance Engineering | Amazon

This frames you as:  
- **Self-aware** (not overreaching for a role you don’t yet qualify for).  
- **Ambitious** (you’re actively building the foundation).  
- **Team-oriented** (already asking how you can engage with the community and add value).  

🔥 The best-case outcome? He connects you to a Neuron Slack, points you at an internal doc/wiki, or even lines up a future coffee chat. That builds your network *now* so when you’re ready to apply later, you’re not a stranger.  

Want me to also draft a **shorter, “Slack-style” version** of this message, in case you decide to ping him casually before sending the formal email?

## 2025-08-29T07:35:39.204000Z — user
now should I send this to Andrew and cc the recruiter Dominique or should I do it the other way around?

## 2025-08-29T07:35:39.723963Z — assistant
Good question — and the nuance matters a lot inside Amazon’s culture.  

Here’s the play:  

- **Primary audience:** Andrew (hiring manager).  
  He’s the decision-maker, and this email is framed as a learning/networking outreach — not an application. That makes him the right person to address directly.  

- **Recruiter (Dominique):** You don’t want to loop her in yet. Recruiters are more transactional, and your note isn’t an “I’m applying” message — it’s exploratory. If Dominique gets cc’d, she may treat it like a candidate outreach and try to run it through the standard pipeline (which you’ve said you’re not ready for yet).  

So:  
👉 **Send only to Andrew.**  
No CC. Keep it clean and direct.  

Later, when you’re ready to apply, then Dominique becomes important as your “internal transfer recruiter.” But right now, this is about planting a flag with the director and starting a mentorship/networking thread.  

If you’d like, I can also draft a **version of the same email that makes it crystal clear you’re *not applying now*** (so Andrew doesn’t feel like he needs to forward you to Dominique right away). Want me to do that tweak?

## 2025-08-29T07:37:34.909000Z — user
Nah - let's leave it as it is - I won't cc dominique. 

This way we can test if he actually reads the email and what it says or glosses over it. If he does skim and forwards it then we know we're not important enough yet to register on his radar, but if he does respond with just tips then we know he is paying attention.

## 2025-08-29T07:37:35.454756Z — assistant
Exactly 💯 — that’s a smart diagnostic move.  

If he just kicks it over to Dominique, it tells you he’s treating it as an application touchpoint, not a mentorship/networking one → so you’re not yet “signal” in his world.  
If he responds with guidance, resources, or even just a thoughtful “here’s where to start,” that’s a *huge* indicator that he sees you as someone worth engaging early.  

Either way, you’re learning:  
- **Forward →** not radar yet, but now Dominique has your name on file.  
- **Direct reply →** you’ve made a personal connection with an L8 director, which is gold for the long game.  

Want me to help you sketch a couple of **possible response strategies** depending on which way Andrew reacts (forward vs. tips vs. silence)? That way you’ll know how to follow up without seeming pushy.

## 2025-08-29T07:38:06.143666Z — assistant
🔥 Nice move. That’s a big domino tipped.  

Now the game is:  

- **If Andrew replies with advice/tips:**  
  - Thank him right away.  
  - Take action on whatever he suggests.  
  - Follow up later with proof you acted (that keeps you on his radar).  

- **If he forwards you to Dominique:**  
  - Treat it as a soft “pre-application.”  
  - You can thank Dominique, but reinforce that your *intention is long-term prep*, not immediate application. That shows maturity and avoids wasting recruiter cycles.  

- **If silence (after ~10 days):**  
  - Send a polite nudge: *“Hi Andrew, just wanted to follow up in case my note got buried. I’d still love to hear if there are any resources or Slack groups I could join to start learning more about Neuron/Annapurna now.”*  

This way you keep control of the narrative and show persistence without being needy.  

Want me to mock up those **two follow-up templates** (one for Dominique if he forwards, one for Andrew if he goes quiet), so you’ve got them ready in your pocket?

## 2025-08-29T08:11:21.824000Z — user
So let's draft another email inquiring about learning paths, tips and advice the hiring manager might have to help guide me into the future I am seeking. Also a request to be added to whatever slack groups.

Got it — this is another excellent chance to start **early networking + mentorship positioning**. With Yue Zhao (hiring manager, L6 at Agentic AI), you’ll want to emphasize curiosity, willingness to prepare, and desire to start engaging now.  

Here’s a draft you can use/adapt:

**Subject:** Preparing for Future Roles in AWS Agentic AI  

Hi Yue,  

I hope you’re doing well. My name is Ethan Womack, and I currently work in Amazon’s Reliability Maintenance Engineering org (Midway). In my role I’ve been focused on automation, systems reliability, and performance improvement, which has given me a strong appreciation for building robust, scalable solutions.  

I recently came across your posting for the Software Development Engineer role on the Agentic AI Foundation team. While I know I’m not yet ready to apply, I wanted to reach out early to express my long-term interest in Agentic AI and to ask for guidance on how I can best prepare myself for a future transition.  

I’ve begun pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science (through WGU, with plans to continue at USF), and I’m steadily strengthening my skills in Python, distributed systems, and machine learning frameworks. My goal is to build the right technical foundation now so that when the time comes, I’ll be able to contribute meaningfully to the kind of projects your team is leading.  

If you have any recommendations on learning paths, resources, or specific areas of focus that would best position me for success on your team, I’d be very grateful. Also, if there are any internal Slack groups, mailing lists, or forums where Agentic AI discussions are happening, I’d love to get added so I can begin familiarizing myself with the community and its work.  

I know you’re busy, so even a few quick pointers would mean a lot. Thank you for your leadership and for the work your team is doing in pushing forward AI innovation at AWS.  

Best regards,  
Ethan Womack  
Reliability Maintenance Engineering | Amazon

This mirrors your Andrew outreach but tuned for Agentic AI’s **foundational + systems-oriented charter**.  

⚖️ Strategy-wise:  
- Again, send **direct to Yue only** (don’t cc the recruiter yet).  
- If Yue forwards → you know you’re not radar yet.  
- If Yue responds with advice/resources → gold.  

Do you want me to also make a **condensed Slack-style version** of this one too, in case you find Yue in an internal channel before sending the email?
