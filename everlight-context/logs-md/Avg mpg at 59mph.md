My avg mpg driving at 59mph with cruise control on

Based on your dashboard:

- **Speed:** 59 mph  
- **Cruise control:** Active (confirmed by the green icon)  
- **Current average MPG:** 32.6 mpg  

That’s a solid efficiency for highway driving. Most vehicles tend to hit peak fuel efficiency between 50–65 mph, so 59 mph with cruise control is a smart choice. If you keep your tires properly inflated and minimize sudden acceleration/braking, you’re likely squeezing close to optimal mileage for your Mazda.

If you want, I can also help you estimate your fuel range or cost per mile.
