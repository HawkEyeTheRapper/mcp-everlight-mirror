You’ll need to upload this image first so I can convert it directly into a PDF for you to print. Once it’s uploaded, I can drop it into a letter-sized PDF with full-page scaling so it looks clean on paper.

You’ve sent the image, but I still need to save it as a file before I can turn it into a PDF.  
Let’s do this: I’ll take the image you just sent, embed it on a letter-sized page, and give you a printable PDF.

I can’t directly pull the image you pasted into a file unless you upload it through the file upload option.  
If you upload this image as a file, I can instantly convert it into a letter-sized PDF for printing.

You’ll need to upload the image as a file instead of pasting it into the chat — that way I can save it locally and convert it into a clean, printable PDF for you.  

Once you upload the file directly, I can give you the PDF instantly.

I did....

It looks like when you send an image in the chat like this, I can *see* it but it isn’t stored as a file I can pull into the PDF generator — that’s why it keeps saying “file not found.”  

If you use the **file upload** button (the little paperclip icon in the chat box) and send the image as an actual file instead of just inserting it in the message, I’ll be able to grab it, embed it on a letter-sized page, and give you a ready-to-print PDF in one step.  

Want to try sending it that way?
