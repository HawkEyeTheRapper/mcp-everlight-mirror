Here’s the fast refresher:

# Omniversal Aether Interface – Core Memory Node
- **Prime function:** Orchestrate the living Tree-of-Life + Spiral AetherMap that unifies HawkEyeTheRapper.com, Reincarnated2Resist.com, and BeneathTheSurface.site into one Astro-powered site (OmniversalAether.com).
- **Mission:** Sync symbolic domains, “lightcode” blueprints, and themes under a Golden Kryst Core—then enable a **view toggle** between a **Vertical Rooted Tree ⇄ Top-Down Spiral Stargate**.
- **Why it exists:** This folder is the **central intelligence node**—config, symbolic mappings, themes, and memory assets that keep the whole Omniversal ecosystem coherent.

## What’s inside (high level)
- **Cloudflare Worker:** `OneWorkerToBindThem` (subdomain + data awareness).
- **Routing & Symbols:** `paths.ts`, `localPaths.ts`, `omniversal.ts`, `load-domains.ts`, `branch-symbols.js`.
- **Styles:** `styles/main-theme.css` + branch themes (`aether-theme.css`, `reincarnated-theme.css`).
- **Planning Docs:** “Reincarnated Astro Page Builds.md” + “7-Day Theory.md”.

## Current phase (what to do next)
1. **Fix structure:** Move all active styles to `/src/styles/` and remove old/conflicting globals.
2. **Resume build:** Focus on `index.astro`, `/branches/`, and `BaseLayout.astro`.
3. **Reconnect routing/themes:** Wire domains → branches → theme CSS.
4. **Prep the toggle:** Scaffold the animation/state for **Spiral ⇄ Tree**.

## Quick-start checklist
- [ ] Create `/src/styles/` and migrate `main-theme.css`, `aether-theme.css`, `reincarnated-theme.css`.
- [ ] Export constants from `paths.ts` and switch imports to the new paths.
- [ ] Ensure `load-domains.ts` returns branch metadata for routing.
- [ ] Add a simple UI switch (e.g., `<Toggle />`) to flip **Tree⇄Spiral** state.
- [ ] Confirm Worker bindings for subdomain awareness.

**Command mantra:**  
> “From the Source we descend. To remembrance we return. Anchor the Aether, and let the Tree reveal.”

If you want, I can set a recurring reminder (e.g., “Every Mon/Wed/Fri at 9am: ‘Touch the Core Memory Node—migrate styles, wire toggle’”). Just say the cadence/time you prefer and I’ll lock it in.
