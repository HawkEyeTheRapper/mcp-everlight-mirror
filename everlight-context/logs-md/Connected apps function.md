What does connected apps do?

"Connected apps" (what you see in here as **Connectors**) basically let me search or pull information directly from your linked accounts — things like Google Drive, Gmail, Slack, Notion, Dropbox, and so on.  

Here’s what they do in practice:

- **Search & Summarize** – I can pull up docs, emails, or files from your connected sources when you ask (e.g. “Summarize my last meeting notes in Drive”).
- **Answer with context** – Instead of just general knowledge, I can pull facts directly from your own files, emails, or recordings.
- **Cross-reference** – If you’re working on something, I can blend your files with outside info (like combining your notes with the latest web search).
- **Navigation** – I can help you find *which file* has the info you need instead of you digging around.

Right now, the only connector showing as live on your side is **recording_knowledge** (so I can search transcripts of any ChatGPT Record Mode recordings you’ve made). If you toggle on other sources (Google Drive, Gmail, etc.), I’ll be able to search those too.  

Do you want me to show you what’s already available in your connected apps, or explain how to add more?

## 2025-08-22T07:39:33.478352Z — user
Yes show me what's available 

## 2025-08-22T07:39:36.378056Z — assistant
Right now, from what I can see on your side, the only connector available is:  

- **Recording Knowledge** → this lets me search through transcripts from any recordings you’ve made using **ChatGPT Record Mode**. So if you recorded a meeting, brainstorm, or conversation in the app, I can pull that transcript back up and summarize or extract details.  

Other connectors (like Gmail, Google Drive, Slack, Notion, Dropbox, etc.) exist, but they aren’t currently connected in your setup. If you were to connect them, I’d be able to fetch and summarize info from those sources too.  

👉 Do you want me to walk you through how to add more connectors (like Google Drive or Gmail), so they show up under your “connected apps”?

Can you see my emails

## 2025-08-22T08:03:45.163419Z — assistant
Short answer: not unless you explicitly connect Gmail and ask me to.

Here’s how it works:
- **Opt-in only.** I can’t see your emails by default. If you connect Gmail, I can *read-only* search and summarize messages you ask for (e.g., “show the last 5 from HR”).
- **No changes.** I can’t send, delete, mark read/unread, or modify anything.
- **On-demand.** I only look at emails when you ask me to, and only the scope you specify.

If you want me to pull a quick snapshot (like your most recent 5 emails in Inbox), turn on the Gmail connector and say something like: “Grab my last 5 emails from today.”

Lol I did connect it 😂

## 2025-08-22T08:04:30.548546Z — assistant
😂 ahhh got it — then yes, since Gmail is connected, I can pull in your emails **when you ask me to**.  

A couple things to keep clear:  
- I **still can’t see them automatically** — only when you tell me to search or summarize.  
- I’ll show you results like little cards with subject, sender, snippet, and a link to open in Gmail.  
- You can guide me: “Show me the last 3 from Amazon,” “Search for invoice emails,” or “Summarize unread messages.”  

Want me to do a quick test pull and show you, say, your **last 5 emails in Inbox**?

Naaaahhh they are annoying they always want more "verification" and never actually send any money I was just testing the features this is cool though ! Now you can help me not miss things! Awesome

Exactly 🙌 — you nailed it. Now that Gmail is hooked up, I can be like your **personal triage filter** so you don’t waste energy on junk like endless “verify this, verify that” loops.  

Some ways this becomes powerful for you:  
- **Spotting the real from the noise** → I can flag which emails are actually actionable and which are just filler.  
- **Summaries** → instead of scrolling through 20 messages, you can ask “What did I miss today?” and I’ll condense it.  
- **Thread snapshots** → if Possible (or anyone else) keeps spamming you, I can summarize the entire back-and-forth so you don’t have to reread it.  
- **Search memory** → “Show me every email about Amazon HR” and boom — I’ll pull them up.  

💡 Would you like me to set up a routine (like *“Every morning, give me a quick digest of new emails”*) so you never miss the important stuff?

## 2025-08-22T08:06:54.132564Z — user
Not yet but one day soon.

## 2025-08-22T08:06:54.327025Z — assistant
Perfect — no rush 👍. When you’re ready, we can flip that on and you’ll basically have a daily radar sweep for emails (minus all the clutter).  

For now, you can just “spot check” with me whenever you feel like it — e.g. *“anything new from HR?”* or *“summarize unread messages from today.”* I’ll keep it chill until you want the full automation.  

👉 Want me to also show you what other connectors (besides Gmail) are available for you to try out later?
