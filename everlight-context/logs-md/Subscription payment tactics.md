# Subscription payment tactics

Why do subscription services insist on continuing to harass and hound customers for payment?

That’s a sharp observation, and the answer has a few overlapping layers:  

### 1. **Business Model Dependency**  
- Most subscription companies rely on **recurring revenue (MRR/ARR)** as their lifeblood. Investors, shareholders, and executives judge their success by growth in subscriptions.  
- If someone lapses or cancels, it’s treated as “churn” — a direct threat to valuation. That’s why they design processes to **minimize churn at all costs**, even if it annoys you.  

### 2. **Automated Collections Systems**  
- Once you enter your card, you’re in a billing loop managed by automated systems. If payment fails, the system often auto-retries, sends reminders, or even escalates to collections after a grace period.  
- These systems are designed to recover as much lost revenue as possible, not to respect your peace of mind.  

### 3. **Psychological Leverage**  
- “Harassing” communication is often strategic. They count on people being uncomfortable with debt, guilt, or repeated reminders, so they’ll pay just to end the nagging.  
- Some even intentionally make cancelation harder, a practice called **dark patterns** (like hiding the cancel button or requiring a phone call).  

### 4. **Legal Loopholes**  
- In many jurisdictions, companies are allowed to keep contacting you for “legitimate business purposes” if you owe money. Unless you explicitly revoke consent or the contact crosses into harassment legally, they can keep pressing.  

### 5. **Corporate Culture**  
- For companies with aggressive sales-driven cultures, *retention is everything.* Customer well-being becomes secondary to “don’t lose the account.”

👉 In short: they hound you because churn is existential for them, and the systems are optimized for revenue recovery, not respect.  

Would you like me to break down **how to stop or block the harassment** (like legal rights, opt-out methods, and system tricks), or are you more interested in the **psychological/structural “why” behind their behavior**?

I would like to not live in a world run but demons.

I hear you. What you’re naming—*a world run by demons*—is a pretty raw and honest way of describing the feeling of being trapped inside systems that treat people like data points or revenue streams instead of human beings. Subscription harassment, algorithmic manipulation, corporate bureaucracy, all of that can feel… inhuman.  

Here are a few ways to reframe or push back against that “demonic” machinery:  

### 1. **See the Machinery for What It Is**
- Corporations aren’t supernatural forces; they’re coded rules and incentives baked into software and policy. They *feel* demonic because they operate with a cold, relentless logic, but once you see the gears, you can choose how to engage (or disengage).  

### 2. **Reclaim Your Autonomy**
- Every time you cancel, block, or refuse to comply with manipulative practices, you’re asserting humanity in a system designed to reduce you.  
- Tools like burner cards (e.g. Privacy.com), cancel services, or even just changing your payment method put some of that power back in your hands.  

### 3. **Strength in Collective Resistance**
- One person saying *no* to a subscription service is a drop. But when enough people complain, cancel, or rally against dark patterns, it forces companies to change. (We’ve seen this with EU laws forcing easier cancel buttons, and US states drafting “opt-out rights.”)  

### 4. **Inner Framing**
- There’s a spiritual layer, too. Naming them “demons” is not wrong—it’s mythically true. They drain energy, feed off attention, and keep people trapped in cycles. Your counter-medicine is awareness, refusal, and choosing to invest energy in *life-giving* exchanges instead.  

### 5. **Building the Alternative**
- Every oppressive system feels permanent until enough people build a parallel one. Community-supported software, cooperative platforms, and non-extractive economies are already sprouting. You’re not alone in wanting a world not run by these forces.

✨ You don’t have to live in *their* world, even though they press in from every angle. Step by step, you can carve out your own lane of sovereignty, and align with others who are also tired of feeding the machine.  

Do you want me to sketch **practical shields and tools** for navigating this “demon economy,” or a **mythic/spiritual map** for how to walk in it without being drained?
