Nice—this is tight. I corrected a tiny typo (“QBureau” → “Bureau of Administrative Reviews”) and set it in a clean printable format. Grab the ready-to-edit RTF here:

[Download the cover letter (RTF)](sandbox:/mnt/data/Administrative_Review_Packet_Cover_Letter_Womack_2025-08-20.rtf)

If you want, I can also spin this into a matching packet table of contents or convert to PDF.

Re: Request for Formal Review & Notice of Intent to Sue  
DL#: W635-224-61-300-0  
Order of Suspension dated August 15, 2025  
To Whom It May Concern:  
Pursuant to Section 322.2615, Florida Statutes, I hereby request a **Formal Review** of the administrative suspension of my driving privilege, as stated in the “Order of License Suspension” dated August 15, 2025.

1. A copy of the Order of Suspension; and  
2. A check or money order in the amount of $25.00 made payable to DHSMV, as required.  
I request that this review be conducted as a Formal Review, in which I may present witnesses, evidence, and arguments. This request is made within the ten (10) day period required by law.  
Additionally, please be advised that I fully reserve all rights to pursue **civil litigation under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and related state and federal claims** for unlawful seizure, deprivation of rights, and violations of constitutional due process arising from this matter. Nothing in this request should be construed as a waiver of those rights.  
Please confirm receipt of this request and advise me of the scheduled date and time of the hearing.  
Respectfully,

Here’s your updated version in clean RTF format, ready to print or edit further:  

[Download the revised request letter (RTF)](sandbox:/mnt/data/Formal_Review_Request_and_Notice_Womack_2025-08-20.rtf)

Do you want me to also generate a **matching Certificate of Service page** for this one like I did on the earlier draft, so it’s packet-ready?

Re: Constitutional Objection to Suspension & Notice of Civil Action  

To Whom It May Concern:  

I object to the requirement that I pay a fee in order to exercise my constitutional rights to due process and to challenge the suspension of my driver’s license. The conditioning of a statutory “review” upon the payment of $25 constitutes an unconstitutional barrier to access to justice and violates:  

- The **Fourth Amendment** protection against unlawful seizure,  
- The **Fourteenth Amendment** guarantee of due process and the right to travel, and  
- 42 U.S.C. § 1983, which provides a cause of action for deprivation of rights under color of law.  

I am complying with the statutory procedure solely to preserve my rights. This compliance should not be construed as consent to an unlawful deprivation, nor as waiver of my right to pursue damages in state and federal court.  

You are hereby placed on notice that I will be seeking remedies for these constitutional violations.  

Respectfully,

[Download the objection letter (RTF)](sandbox:/mnt/data/Constitutional_Objection_and_Notice_Womack_2025-08-20.rtf)

Would you like me to also combine all three letters (cover, formal review, and constitutional objection) into a **single packet file** with a table of contents, so it’s print-and-mail ready?

## 2025-08-20T14:27:28.650585Z — user

Format broken for some reason

## 2025-08-20T14:27:28.872537Z — assistant
Ah, I see what happened. The broken formatting (like `driverâ€™s` and `â€œreviewâ€`) is because the RTF was written with UTF-8 encoding, but your phone’s RTF reader (likely Google Docs) expects plain ANSI/Windows-1252 characters. That mismatch makes quotation marks and apostrophes show up as garbage symbols.  

✅ Fix: I’ll rebuild the RTF using **ANSI-safe characters only** (straight quotes `'` and `"` instead of curly quotes). That way, it will open cleanly in Word, LibreOffice, or Google Docs without those encoding errors.  

Here’s what I can do for you next:  
- Clean ANSI-safe RTF (no broken characters).  
- Or, if you prefer, a **PDF version** (that guarantees formatting looks the same everywhere).  

Do you want me to regenerate this as a **clean RTF** or just give you a **PDF** so it looks perfect no matter what?

## 2025-08-20T14:28:04.498464Z — user
I just need them all to look the same

## 2025-08-20T14:28:05.131344Z — assistant
Got it — consistency across the whole packet is what matters most. Right now, the difference is just encoding: the first cover letter looked fine because it only used plain characters, but the later ones had curly quotes and symbols that tripped Google Docs.  

Best solution:  
- I’ll regenerate **all three letters** (Cover Letter, Formal Review Request, and Constitutional Objection) in a **single format set**.  
- I’ll use straight quotes and ANSI-safe characters, so they all render identically.  
- Then I can either bundle them into **one PDF (recommended for mailing/printing)** or keep them as three clean RTFS.  

👉 Do you want me to unify them into **one PDF packet with a table of contents**, or keep them as **three separate but consistent letters**?

## 2025-08-20T14:29:27.918696Z — user
Okay PDF is fine as long as they're all on separate single pages

All set ✅ — I’ve compiled everything into **one PDF packet** with each letter on its own page, clean and consistent formatting throughout.  

[Download the complete Administrative Review Packet (PDF)](sandbox:/mnt/data/Womack_Administrative_Review_Packet_2025-08-20.pdf)  

Do you also want me to draft a **Table of Contents** as the first page (listing Cover Letter, Formal Review Request, Constitutional Objection) so the packet is fully professional?
