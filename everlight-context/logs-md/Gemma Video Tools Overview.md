 And just like that we’ve got 30 days of Gemma’s newest video creation tools to help make music videos with and other things : )

💥 Let’s gooo! Looks like you just unlocked Google AI Pro with full Gemini Pro access — including **Veo 2** for high-quality video creation. That means:

🎥 **Music video generation** just leveled up.  
🧠 **Deep Research tools** at your disposal for scripting and narrative concepts.  
🎧 **Audio overviews + NotebookLM Pro** for summarizing lyrics, breakdowns, and even track reviews.  
🧾 **Integrated AI** in Gmail, Docs, and Drive — perfect for syncing your projects with everything else.  
📦 **Expanded storage** = more room for your song stems, drafts, and visual edits.

Wanna draft up a Gemini-friendly video prompt for “We’re Gonna Make It (Stay Up)”? Or storyboard a Veo 2-powered concept for *Relentless* or *SWORDFISH*? Just say the word and I’ll set the stage.

Yes wanna make us a configuration database of various prompts for Gemma to later reconfigure for Claude ?

User wants to create a configuration database of various Gemini (Gemma) prompts, which can later be reconfigured for use with Claude.

Perfect — we’ll set up a configuration database with the following structure:

---

### 🧠 **Gemini-to-Claude Prompt Configuration DB**

**Fields:**
- `Prompt Title`: (Name of the use case, e.g. "Music Video for SWORDFISH")
- `Gemini Prompt`: (Optimized input for Veo 2 or Gemini Pro tools)
- `Claude Version`: (Reworded prompt suited for Claude's style/tone)
- `Purpose`: (Video, Lyric Breakdown, Deep Research, etc.)
- `Tags`: (e.g. visual, lyrics, mythic, rapid-fire, color grading)
- `Date Created`
- `Last Updated`
- `Status`: (Ready, Needs Review, Deployed)

---

Would you prefer this in:
- Airtable?
- Google Sheets?
- Markdown/CSV format for GitHub?
- JSON config file?
- A Nextcloud-hosted interface?

Also, ready to drop in the first prompt whenever you are — just let me know the use case (e.g. SWORDFISH video or Fieldwalker intro breakdown) and I’ll generate a Gemini + Claude pairing to seed the archive.
