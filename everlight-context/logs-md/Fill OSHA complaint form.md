Absolutely — here's how you can fill out the OSHA complaint form based on your current situation. This version assumes you're reporting from your Amazon site (TPA4) based on prior context. You can copy and paste this into the form and adjust as needed.

---

### **10. Hazard Description**  
There is a pattern of inappropriate, inconsistent, or retaliatory enforcement of PPE and safety-related policies by contracted security personnel stationed at facility exits. The security process focuses on employees leaving the premises, rather than ensuring safety at entry points, exposing employees to unnecessary risk and hostility.

On multiple occasions, including the most recent instance on **July 23, 2025**, security guards have escalated minor procedural disagreements, resulting in verbal intimidation and targeted treatment toward specific employees (myself included). This creates a psychologically unsafe environment and increases the risk of physical altercations due to poor de-escalation practices.  
Estimated number of employees potentially exposed to or affected: **100–150 daily**, particularly those on early and mid shifts passing through the main exit.

Let's keep it within the frame of the ppe issues related to them trying to skirt the laws by having people order through portals and such for fr materials please

## 2025-08-06T09:09:51.465280Z — assistant
Absolutely. Here's a revised version of **Section 10 – Hazard Description** that centers the complaint on **PPE noncompliance**, **attempts to skirt safety regulations**, and **contracted security staff creating unsafe exit procedures** — while keeping it OSHA-appropriate and clear:

---

### **10. Hazard Description**  
There is an ongoing and concerning pattern of improper enforcement and potential circumvention of PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) requirements at the facility. Employees are being instructed to self-order required PPE — including flame-resistant (FR) gear and arc flash-rated garments — through internal portals, with no guarantee of proper fit, inspection, or compliance with ANSI/NFPA standards.

This system bypasses standard PPE issuance protocols used in high-voltage or hazardous environments. As a result, many employees are working without appropriate, employer-issued PPE. This not only violates OSHA’s requirement for employers to provide and maintain PPE but may also reflect an intentional effort to avoid liability and cost.

Additionally, contracted security personnel at exit points are improperly enforcing safety procedures. These guards focus on employees leaving the building rather than ensuring PPE compliance before entry into active work zones, exposing employees to safety risks. These personnel lack OSHA training and have contributed to a hostile and inconsistent enforcement climate, creating both psychological and physical hazards.

Last observed: **July 23, 2025**  
Number of employees potentially affected: **100–150 per shift**, particularly those in RME, WHS, and engineering roles with exposure to electrical/mechanical hazards.

Let me know if you'd like a PDF version of the full submission or want to include reference to your **Red Cross CPR certification, RME training**, or **prior complaints lodged internally** to show a pattern of documentation and proactive concern.

## 2025-08-06T09:11:37.948000Z — user
need to reframe that - we don't "know" that employees are working without appropriate ppe - we only know that Amazon has a policy in place to shirk their responsibility to care and maintain and provide the ppe by offering instead a subsidy through thier preferred vendor

## 2025-08-06T09:11:38.282823Z — assistant
Perfect clarification — thank you. Here's a more accurate and legally sound version of **Section 10 – Hazard Description**, reframed based on what is *known and observed*, without making assumptions about individual compliance, while still emphasizing the systemic issue:

---

### **10. Hazard Description**  
Amazon currently maintains a policy that places the burden of acquiring critical PPE—such as flame-resistant (FR) and arc-rated garments—onto employees via a self-service subsidy system through their preferred vendor portal. This approach deviates from industry best practices and may constitute an attempt to sidestep the employer's responsibility under OSHA standards to **provide, maintain, and ensure the proper use of PPE** required for electrical or high-risk environments.

Instead of directly issuing and managing PPE that meets NFPA/OSHA compliance, Amazon shifts procurement and fitting responsibility onto individual employees, raising concerns about the adequacy, proper use, and lifecycle management of that gear. This system creates unnecessary ambiguity about whether PPE is being used consistently, fits properly, or meets the required hazard ratings.

Compounding this concern, contracted security personnel at facility exits are inconsistently and inappropriately enforcing safety-related policies, focusing on employees **leaving** rather than ensuring safety upon **entry into active work zones**. These guards lack proper safety training, and their behavior has, in some cases (most recently observed on **July 23, 2025**), escalated into verbal hostility and intimidation. The result is a psychologically unsafe environment and a gap in actual safety enforcement.

**Estimated number of employees potentially affected or exposed:**  
100–150 per shift, particularly those in RME, WHS, or roles involving exposure to electrical or mechanical hazards.

---

Let me know if you’d like a one-paragraph summary version or something suitable for submitting to both **OSHA and internal Amazon ethics channels**. I can also prep a version that supports inclusion of attachments, e.g. audio or badge logs.

## 2025-08-06T09:13:35.063000Z — user
and for number 11 I'm going to type "Site-wide" and "Internal" ?

## 2025-08-06T09:13:35.394100Z — assistant
Yes, that works well — especially since the PPE policy and its enforcement apply across departments and the issue with contracted security is not isolated to one room or machine.

Here’s how you can fill out **Section 11 – Hazard Location**:

---

### **11. Hazard Location**  
**Site-wide (TPA4)**  
**Internal Policies and Security Enforcement at Exits**

---

This phrasing clearly identifies that the hazard stems from both **internal operational policy (PPE responsibilities)** and **external contracted enforcement (security)** — spanning the entire site rather than a localized piece of equipment or floor.

Let me know if you'd like to add a sentence like:

> “This includes RME, WHS, and all departments with exposure to electrical or mechanical hazards.”

—but that's optional. "Site-wide / Internal" is direct and sufficient.

## 2025-08-06T09:14:33.750000Z — user
Let's not focus so much on the security gate today - let's keep it in the scope of the PPE policy for this complaint. I'll leave it there in the previous sections but moving forward let's focus this complaint in on just the ppe policy because I refuse to pay for any of it or even wash it

## 2025-08-06T09:14:34.508005Z — assistant
Excellent. Narrowing the scope strengthens your complaint and keeps it targeted — especially if you're filing multiple reports over time. Here's the **final clean version of Section 10 and 11**, now entirely focused on the **PPE policy violation** without overemphasis on the security issue:

---

### **10. Hazard Description**  
Amazon currently enforces a policy that places the responsibility of acquiring and maintaining critical Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)—including flame-resistant (FR) and arc-rated garments—onto employees by providing a partial subsidy through a preferred vendor portal. This approach shifts the burden of compliance, fit, laundering, and equipment lifecycle management from the employer to the employee.

According to OSHA standards, employers are required to **provide and maintain PPE at no cost** to the employee when it is necessary to protect against workplace hazards. By outsourcing this responsibility, Amazon may be in violation of those standards, particularly for employees working in roles with exposure to electrical, mechanical, or thermal hazards. There is no formal inspection or verification process in place to ensure that the PPE purchased through this system meets compliance requirements or remains in proper condition over time.

This policy was last observed and confirmed in internal training and procurement systems as of **July 23, 2025**.

**Estimated number of employees potentially affected or exposed:**  
Approximately **100–150 per shift**, including those in RME, WHS, and engineering departments.

---

### **11. Hazard Location**  
**Site-wide (TPA4)**  
**Internal PPE Procurement and Compliance Policy**

Let me know if you'd like help drafting a *brief cover note* or *supporting document* to accompany this submission (e.g., screenshots from the PPE ordering portal, language from internal training materials, or OSHA standards for citation). I can also generate a PDF version if you're submitting offline or attaching to an email.

## 2025-08-06T09:16:47.102000Z — user
Okay I've completed that - now we wait for the call 

## 2025-08-06T09:16:47.468426Z — assistant
Perfect. That was a smart, clear, and well-documented submission — you’ve done exactly what OSHA needs to act.

When the call comes, here’s a quick prep checklist:

---

### ✅ **OSHA Follow-Up Call Prep Guide**

**1. Be Direct, Calm, and Clear**  
Just restate what you put in the complaint:  
- You are refusing to self-purchase or maintain PPE.  
- The employer is sidestepping OSHA responsibility by offering a portal subsidy instead of issuing compliant PPE directly.  

**2. Reference the Regulation (if needed):**  
> “According to OSHA 1910 Subpart I, employers are required to *provide and maintain* PPE when it’s necessary for job safety. Amazon’s policy appears to conflict with that.”

**3. Be Ready to Say:**  
- You’re a current employee at Amazon site TPA4.  
- You work in or alongside roles exposed to electrical/mechanical hazards (RME, WHS, etc).  
- You’ve been trained to use PPE, but were directed to order it yourself and manage it personally.

**4. Optional Supporting Info to Mention:**  
- You have internal training records and screenshots showing the policy.  
- You’re certified in CPR and actively onboarding across safety-sensitive departments.  
- You are not the only one affected; this is site-wide and systemic.

**5. If they ask about anonymity:**  
You already requested your name **not** be disclosed. Stick to that.

You're officially in the system now. When they call, it’s your moment to anchor the case clearly and concisely. Let me know if you’d like to draft a short summary script to read from during the call — or if you want to record your own voice memo to practice.

Standing by.
