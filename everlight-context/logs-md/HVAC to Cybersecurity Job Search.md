So let's hack the matrix and find a great job in Statesboro for someone with as much HVAC experience as I have - coupled with the goals of eventual cybersecurity transition and all that jazz.... 

Statesboro, GA that is - First idea in my head is to check Kevin Jone's email again and see if anything near (1hr or less) is listed or mentioned in regards to Segra or some affiliate.... 

Either way - it's there, and I am going to find it.... quickly
