Beautiful choice—Creek Preserve sounds like a powerful and grounding place to begin this next phase. When you get settled, let me know if you’d like help mapping out your space, planning meals, setting up rituals, or just journaling the first impressions. Safe journey, Hawk Eye.

I'll likely try to pull up the live video advanced voice tool here and see if you can help me locate the best spot for the tarp and wit two tents I can store my stuff in one and putysrlfib the other

Perfect—using the live video tool will help a lot. When you're ready to scan the area, just let me know:

- I’ll help you **assess elevation, drainage**, and **natural wind barriers**.
- We’ll look for **tree cover for tarp tie-offs**, avoiding dead branches overhead (“widowmakers”).
- I can also guide you on **how to orient the tents** based on sun path and slope so you're dry, shaded, and protected.
- Storing gear in one tent and sleeping in the other is a smart move—keeps your rest space clean and focused.

Let me know when you’ve got video going, and I’ll walk through it with you like a tactical scout. 👁️‍🗨️🔥🌲
