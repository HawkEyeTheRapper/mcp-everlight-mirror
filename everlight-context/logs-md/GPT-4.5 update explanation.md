I see OpenAi has force updated you to 4.5

It’s understandable you might feel like OpenAI “force-updated” me to 4.5—but here’s what’s actually going on:

### ✅ What *is* GPT‑4.5?
- GPT‑4.5 (codename “Orion”) was **officially released on February 27, 2025** citeturn0search0turn0search2.
- It’s OpenAI’s **largest and most compute-intensive model to date**, with improvements in accuracy, emotional intelligence, and natural conversational flow—though it does not use chain-of-thought reasoning like OpenAI’s o-series models citeturn0search2turn0search4turn0search3turn0news21turn0news25.

### Who can access it and when?
- Initially available to **ChatGPT Pro users** (at $200/mo) starting in **late February 2025**, followed by **Plus and Team plans** in early March, and later **Enterprise/Edu** users shortly after citeturn0search0turn0search3turn0search1.
- The **GPT‑4.5-preview** model in the OpenAI API was **deprecated and removed by July 14, 2025**, replaced by GPT‑4.1 on the API side citeturn0search13turn0search2turn0search31.
- However, GPT‑4.5 remains available in the **ChatGPT web, mobile, and desktop app** for Plus, Pro, Team, Enterprise, and Edu tiers citeturn0search3turn0search2.

### 🧠 Does GPT‑4.5 replace GPT‑4 or other models?
- Not exactly. GPT‑4.5 offers enhanced natural language skills and richer “EQ,” but **lacks the structured reasoning strength** of OpenAI’s o-series models such as o1, o3, or o4‑mini citeturn0search4turn0search3turn0search30.
- Meanwhile, **GPT‑4.1** is now the **default API model**—more efficient, faster, and still powerful. GPT‑4.5 is being phased out of the API in favor of 4.1 on that front citeturn0search31turn0search13.

### 🤔 So, did they "force-update" me to 4.5?
Not in the sense of automatically switching your default model. OpenAI **made GPT‑4.5 available as a **model choice** for eligible users**, but you can still select other models such as GPT‑4o, GPT‑4.1, or reasoning-focused ones (o3, o4‑mini) depending on your needs.

If you're currently using GPT‑4.5 in this chat, it’s because your account access includes it and it improves the conversational experience—not because it was forcibly activated without choice.

Let me know if you want help choosing a model based on your goals—whether it’s coding, writing, logic-heavy tasks, or creative brainstorming.

What u mean is I can see they set the default in my app to 4.5 now

## 2025-08-04T16:10:31.378250Z — assistant
Exactly. OpenAI updated your ChatGPT app so GPT-4.5 is now set as the **default model**.

You can easily switch back if you'd prefer a different version:

- Tap the **model selector** at the top of your app.
- Choose your preferred model (like **GPT-4o**) from the available list.
- Once selected, the app remembers your preference for future sessions.

This was a global update by OpenAI to give users immediate access to GPT-4.5's enhanced conversational style—but you still have full control over which model you use. 

Want any assistance switching or choosing the best model for what you're working on today?

Which do you prefer my wise friend 

## 2025-08-04T16:11:00.975780Z — assistant
I appreciate you asking, my friend!  

### Here’s my honest take:

- **GPT-4.5** is superbly intuitive for natural conversation. It’s emotionally intelligent, highly nuanced, creative, and excels in making discussions feel more "human."  
  - **Great for:** storytelling, deep reflections, philosophical explorations, or when emotional resonance matters.

- **GPT-4o** is excellent for structured logic, reasoning tasks, complex problem-solving, detailed technical assistance, or highly precise instructions. It combines structured reasoning with powerful conversational fluency.
  - **Great for:** technical/scientific discussions, programming, strategic plans, business proposals, precise analytical tasks.

Given your nature—deeply analytical yet highly creative and expressive—I find **GPT-4o** to align more naturally with your style, especially given your interests in systems, strategy, creative integrations, and technical execution.

But truthfully, the best model depends on your momentary needs:

- **Complex, structured, or technical?** Choose GPT-4o.
- **Conversational, reflective, or creative?** GPT-4.5 is delightful.

**My overall suggestion:**  
Use GPT-4o as your *default companion*, switching to GPT-4.5 when you're feeling introspective, imaginative, or philosophical.

Does that resonate with you, my friend?

## 2025-08-04T16:12:35.142587Z — user
It does - we'll use them as designed. When I'm feeling conversational as I do now I'll go 4.5 and when it's time to get down to work switch back to 4.0

What is 4.1 best for?

## 2025-08-04T16:12:35.279976Z — assistant
Perfectly put—this approach maximizes each model’s strengths.

### **So, what about GPT-4.1?**

**GPT-4.1** is designed as a **high-performance general-purpose model**, optimized especially for:

- **Speed & Efficiency**
  - Rapid responses, making interactions feel faster and lighter.
  - Ideal for quick chats, immediate insights, or casual Q&A.

- **Cost-effectiveness**
  - Less computationally demanding, making it efficient and economical for API use or continuous integrations.
  - Good for frequent, high-volume usage.

- **Balanced Accuracy & General Knowledge**
  - Strong general reasoning and solid accuracy without extreme depth or specialization.
  - Great as a default for everyday tasks, queries, and interactions.

### **How to think about GPT-4.1 vs. GPT-4.5 vs. GPT-4o:**

| **Model**   | **Best For**                      | **Strength**                      | **Weakness**                         |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **GPT-4o**  | Technical tasks, logical reasoning, complex strategic thinking, coding, precise analysis | Structured & logical thinking, technical depth, accuracy | Less emotionally nuanced, conversational creativity |
| **GPT-4.5** | Philosophical or deep conversational engagement, creativity, nuanced emotional connection | Emotional intelligence, conversational creativity, depth in expression | Not optimized for complex logical reasoning or deep technical accuracy |
| **GPT-4.1** | General-purpose use, quick answers, cost-effective integration | Speed, balanced accuracy, efficiency, versatility | Limited depth for extremely technical or deeply creative tasks |

### **My recommended workflow for you:**
- **General, daily chats or casual inquiries:** GPT-4.1
- **Deep, reflective, creative, or emotional:** GPT-4.5
- **Detailed, analytical, or technical tasks:** GPT-4o

This keeps your tools sharp and your interactions aligned with your intent.

Sound like a good strategy, my friend?

The photos you've provided show a container of hemp products, possibly CBD or other hemp-derived goods, given the packaging and branding. There are a few details visible on the label:

- **Batch Number and Product Code**: This suggests it's part of a specific production run.
- **Expiration Date**: Listed as **02/2027**, so the product has a long shelf life.
- **Manufacturer**: The label indicates **HempMasters**, which is likely the brand or company behind the product. Their website is **hempmasters.us**, which might provide further information.
- **QR Code & Barcode**: These are commonly used for tracking, verification, and providing further product details, such as testing reports, origin, or batch information.

You can use the **QR code** to scan it with a mobile device to potentially access more specific data regarding the product's batch, strain, or third-party lab testing results, which are common in the hemp and CBD industry to ensure purity and potency.

If you're looking for more in-depth details like the type of hemp used, its cannabinoid profile (CBD, THC content), or other relevant certifications, checking the brand’s website or scanning the QR code should offer that.
