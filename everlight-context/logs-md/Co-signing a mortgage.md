# Co-signing a mortgage

Oh shit... Between me  Jono and Cody if they have good credit they could co sign on a house with me couldn't they?

Yes — in theory, if Jono or Cody (or both) have strong credit and steady income, they *could* co-sign a mortgage with you. Here’s how it usually works:  

---

### How Co-Signing on a Mortgage Works
- **Credit leverage**: The lender looks at all applicants’ credit. If yours is shaky, a co-signer with good credit can tip approval in your favor.  
- **Income boost**: Lenders also add up everyone’s income. That means their steady earnings can help you qualify for a higher loan amount.  
- **Shared liability**: A co-signer isn’t just “vouching” for you — they’re legally on the hook. If you miss payments, it dings their credit and they could be pursued for the debt.  

---

### Things to Consider
1. **Trust factor**: Everyone signing is tied together financially. If you split or fall out, it can get messy.  
2. **Ownership vs. liability**: Sometimes co-signers are on the mortgage but not the deed (so they’re liable without equity). Worth deciding upfront.  
3. **Exit plan**: Usually the only ways to release a co-signer are refinancing later in your name alone, or selling the house.  

---

### Tactical Angle
If you, Jono, and Cody are thinking of this:
- Check all three credit scores first (you can use Credit Karma for a soft look).  
- Run the math with a mortgage broker — they’ll tell you exactly what loan amount the combined income/credit could unlock.  
- Draft a written side-agreement between yourselves about who’s paying what and how equity is split (that way nobody feels blindsided later).

👉 Want me to sketch out a **step-by-step playbook** for you three on how to approach a lender together without accidentally over-exposing your friends?

## 2025-08-17T13:37:32.376595Z — user
The idea is for us three to pitch it and use it for our businesses later

## 2025-08-17T13:37:32.493254Z — assistant
Ahhh okay — now we’re talking strategy, not just survival. If the idea is **you three pitch together, get into a house, and later convert it into a business hub / income-generating property**, that opens up a few more levers:  

---

## 1. **Positioning It With the Bank**
- **Primary residence vs. investment property**:  
   - Mortgages for a *primary home* are cheaper (lower down payment, lower rates).  
   - Investment property loans require more cash down (15–25%) and stricter underwriting.  
   - If one of you is willing to live there initially, you can leverage “primary residence” rules and then convert later.  

- **Combined income & credit**:  
   - The three of you together can look strong on paper — especially if at least one has a high credit score and stable W-2 income.  
   - Lenders like to see multiple incomes because it lowers risk.  

---

## 2. **Future Business Angle**
- **Shared HQ / creative space**: Once secured, you could legally form an LLC (say, under *Omniversal Media* or a new joint venture). The house could double as HQ, studio, or office.  
- **House hacking**: Rent out portions (rooms, basement, ADU, etc.) to offset the mortgage and free cash for your ventures.  
- **Refinance later**: After a year or two, you can refinance into a business/commercial loan, or one of you could refinance in your own name to release the others from liability.  

---

## 3. **Safeguards for the Three of You**
- **Written agreement**: Before signing, decide:  
   - Who pays what share of the mortgage/expenses.  
   - How equity is split when you sell or refinance.  
   - What happens if one person can’t pay or wants out.  
- **LLC wrapper**: You can eventually deed the property into an LLC owned by the three of you — helps with liability and bookkeeping if it becomes a business asset.  

---

## 4. **Pitch Playbook**
1. **Check credit & income docs**: Each of you should pull FICO scores and gather recent pay stubs/tax returns.  
2. **Decide “who lives there”** (at least on paper) to qualify for a primary residence mortgage.  
3. **Meet with a mortgage broker** (not just a bank) — they can shop your combined profile across lenders.  
4. **Run scenarios**: Primary residence loan vs. investment property loan — compare down payments, monthly costs, and risks.  
5. **Draft your internal agreement** so everyone knows the rules before you sign.  

---

⚡ In other words: Yes, it’s totally doable — but you want to pitch it like *“three incomes, one roof, future business HQ”* and keep your legal ducks in a row so it doesn’t blow up later.  

---

Want me to draw up a **sample internal agreement outline** for you three — like a “pre-LLC pact” — so you don’t get burned if someone bails or the business takes off?

## 2025-08-17T13:40:38.177304Z — user
We would all three in theory go in together on the house for a private residence. Later on we'd use it as a base of operations in Florida to branch out and buy other properties and thing

## 2025-08-17T13:40:38.293074Z — assistant
Got it — that’s actually a smart hybrid move: **use a residential mortgage to get in cheap, then pivot it into your launchpad for a real estate + business play.** Let me lay it out:  

---

## Phase 1: Private Residence (Entry Point)
- **Loan type**: You, Jono, and Cody apply jointly for a *primary residence* mortgage. This keeps down payment and interest rates way lower than if you went straight “investment property.”  
- **Living arrangement**: At least one of you has to legitimately live there to satisfy the “owner-occupied” requirement. (The bank doesn’t care *which* one, as long as it’s true.)  
- **Equity building**: All three contribute to down payment + monthly mortgage = you’re building shared equity from day one.  

---

## Phase 2: Business Incubator (Conversion)
- Once you’re in and stable, you slowly **shift the property’s function**:  
   - Use a portion as HQ (studio, office, meeting space).  
   - House hacking (Airbnb rooms, rent out extra space) to help cover the mortgage.  
   - Register your LLC(s) at that address → now it doubles as a business base.  

---

## Phase 3: Scaling Out (Branching Strategy)
- **Leverage equity**: As the property appreciates and you pay down the loan, you can pull out equity (HELOC, cash-out refi) to fund your *next* purchase.  
- **Track record**: Lenders look more favorably once you already own property + have a history of payments.  
- **Branch out**: Buy additional properties in Florida under an LLC or a joint venture agreement. The first house acts like your anchor and credibility builder.  

---

## Safeguards for You Three
- **Internal Agreement** (pre-LLC pact): Before you sign, write down:  
   - Who’s putting in what (down payment %).  
   - Who pays what each month.  
   - Exit clauses (e.g., if one wants out → others have right to buy them out at appraised value).  
- **Ownership split**: All three names can go on both the deed and mortgage. Or, you could structure it as one primary borrower with others co-signing (less ideal for fairness).  
- **LLC Transition**: Later, you can deed the house into an LLC you all own. This makes it easier to pivot it fully into “company HQ / asset.”  

---

⚡ In short:  
1. **Buy as a residence together → get best rates.**  
2. **Convert it gradually into your HQ.**  
3. **Leverage equity + income to buy more properties.**  

That first house becomes your *foothold* in Florida, the keystone asset you use to branch out.  

---

Do you want me to draft a **step-by-step tactical roadmap** (like months 1–24) that shows how you three could go from “first house together” → “full-on property network”?

Cody says he's down to go in on a piece of property with me.

Can you see if we can find any information online for the property listed for sale at 8006 Angus Valley road or drive in 33544

I wasn't able to find any publicly listed property at **8006 Angus Valley Road or Drive**, 33544—nothing is showing up on major real estate platforms. It's possible that the property is:

- Not listed for sale,
- Listed under a slightly different address (typo or variant),
- A private sale or under contract, or
- Described differently in official records.

### What I Did Find Nearby
While the specific address didn’t come up, I checked the surrounding **Angus Valley / Wesley Chapel** area—here's what’s currently on the market:

- **6008 Angus Valley Dr**

### What You Can Do Next

1. **Double-check the Address**
   - Is it “Road” vs. “Drive”? Confirm the house number and spelling with your contact or tax records.

2. **Try County Property Records**
   - Pasco County Property Appraiser’s site might show ownership details and sale history for 8006 Angus Valley.

3. **Contact Local Realtors or a Broker**
   - A local agent might know of off-market listings, unlisted sellers, or upcoming opportunities.

4. **Explore Comparable Listings**
   - Even if that exact property isn’t available, nearby homes give you a strong price and size point of reference for valuation and strategy.

Jesus Christ nevermind then.... I'm gonna have to look into empty lots elsewhere because God damn that's ridiculous 

## 2025-08-17T15:29:23.896144Z — assistant
Yeah man, welcome to Florida 2025 real estate 😅 — even manufactured homes in Angus Valley are creeping into the **$300k+ zone**, which is wild considering those same places were under $100k just a few years back.  

If your play is long-term **business base + expansion**, then honestly:  

---

## Why Empty Lots Might Be Smarter
- **Lower entry cost**: Raw land is way cheaper, especially if you look a bit outside Wesley Chapel.  
- **Flexibility**: You can drop a manufactured home, modular build, or even phase in multiple small units.  
- **Business leverage**: Land = collateral. Even unimproved, you can refinance or use it to secure capital.  
- **Fewer “owner-occupied” hoops**: No lender breathing down your neck about living there first.  

---

## Tactics You Could Run
1. **Search Pasco + Hernando + Polk Counties** — land there is still a fraction of Wesley Chapel’s insanity.  
2. **Look for zoning that allows multi-use** (residential + light business) → future HQ ready.  
3. **Check utilities**: Big difference between “lot with power/septic nearby” vs. “literally swamp land.”  
4. **Owner financing**: Some land sellers will carry the note themselves → bypass banks until you’re ready to build.  

---

## Example Angles
- Buy a **1–2 acre lot** for under $60k.  
- Drop a modular home or two for living space.  
- Over time, add a workshop/office.  
- When the businesses are cash-flowing, leverage that property into bigger acquisitions.

##  Next Moves: How to Zero In With Cody

1. **Pick your zone**:
   - Want **cheap and usable**? Interlachen or Citrus Springs.
   - Prefer **space and flexibility**? Okeechobee or Mayo.
2. **Dig into details**:
   - Confirm zoning: residential, modular-friendly?
   - Check access: road frontage, utilities (power, septic).
3. **Financing options**:
   - Some listings offer owner financing or low down payments—great until you’re ready for development.
4. **Scope of build**:
   - Even a tiny lot can work for modular/hybrid use. Big acreage lets you spread out and stack structures over time.
5. **Next tool**:
   - Want me to pull actual URLs or broker contacts for specific parcels? Or scope out lots by map with depth?

You’re in a sweet spot—$25K or less gives you genuine optionality. Let me know which area vibes most with your build style, and I’ll go deeper.

Here’s what the typical vacant lot near the 33637 ZIP area of Tampa looks like—urban, tight, and not cheap. Now, let’s break down where you're at and what’s realistic.

---

##  Land Market Near 33637 (Tampa, Ruskin, Sun City)

- **LandSearch shows only 23 properties for sale near 33637**, average listing price is about **$1.3 million**, and cost per acre is around **$368k**. That’s well beyond your $25k budget. citeturn0search0
- Zillow confirms: in nearby areas like 33629, 33611, etc., land listings typically range from **$250k to well over $500k**. citeturn0search3turn0search9

---

##  So… Is $25K Possible Near 33637?

**Short answer:** Not within your desired ZIP code. Urban lots in that region are **not available** under $25k. You’d need to look much farther from the city center.

---

##  Smart Alternatives: Land Under $25K in Florida—But Farther Out

While there’s nothing affordable near 33637, you *can* find cheap land in places like Putnam, Marion, Okeechobee, and Jackson counties. Check these examples:

- **Putnam County (Interlachen)**: ~0.43 acres for **$22,200**, with owner financing options. citeturn0search5
- **Fort McCoy (Marion County)**: ~0.29 acres for **$20,000**, with $200 down and $200/month financing. citeturn0search5
- **Okeechobee County (Viking Estates)**: 2.5 acres for **$25,000**—plenty of room to build, but remote. citeturn0search5

These are viable options, but they come with a significant commute.

## Table: Land Under $25K (But Farther From Tampa)

| Location                          | Price        | Size              | Notes                         |
|-----------------------------------|--------------|-------------------|--------------------------------|
| Interlachen (Putnam Co.)          | $22,200      | ~0.43 acres       | Owner financing available      |
| Fort McCoy (Marion Co.)           | $20,000      | ~0.29 acres       | Low down payment financing     |
| Viking Estates (Okeechobee Co.)   | $25,000      | 2.5 acres         | Rural, flexible land sizing    |

---

##  Your Options

1. **Expand Radius** – If commute time is feasible, consider properties 1–2 hours out. Build there, then use as your growth base.
2. **Step-Up Plan** – Use these cheap parcels as initial assets. Meanwhile, save or reinvest until you can purchase closer-in land.
3. **Other Financing Avenues** – Owner financing, land contracts, or creative deals could give you underground options even if location is a stretch.

Let me know if you’d like me to pull actual listing links or broker contact info for these cheaper areas—or map out which counties balance cost and commute time best.
