What's 114+316 + 117 + 158+158?

## 2025-08-13T22:29:24.252541Z — assistant

Let’s add it step-by-step:

1. **114 + 316** = 430  
2. **430 + 117** = 547  
3. **547 + 158** = 705  
4. **705 + 158** = 863  

**Final answer:** **863**

That's not enough to pay Cody 600 and Sonia 350

## 2025-08-13T22:29:43.095020Z — assistant
Right — if you’ve only got **863**, paying Cody **600** and Sonia **350** would require:  

- **600 + 350 = 950** total needed  
- **950 − 863 = 87** short  

So you’d be **$87 short** to cover both payments in full.

What if I give Cody 300 this week and 300 next week how much is that? They didn't pay me for this past Saturday yet Tori already said it would be reflected on next check 

## 2025-08-13T22:30:31.525480Z — assistant
If you split Cody’s payment into **$300 this week** and **$300 next week**, that totals:  

- **300 + 300 = 600**  

So Cody still gets the full **$600**, just over two pay periods.  

Given your current **$863** on hand:  

- **$863 − $300 (Cody this week)** = **$563 left**  
- **$563 − $350 (Sonia)** = **$213 left** this week  

Then next week, you’d just need to cover Cody’s other $300 — and your extra pay for last Saturday should help with that.  

Do you want me to run a full two-week cash flow chart including that missing Saturday pay so you can see if you’ll still have cushion?
