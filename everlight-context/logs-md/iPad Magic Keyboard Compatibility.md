I bought a iPad Magic Keyboard to use with the new iPad when it gets here but I’m wondering if I can use it with my Mac mini in the meantime or maybe even my iphone?

The **iPad Magic Keyboard** (the one with the floating hinge and trackpad) is designed specifically for iPads and connects via the Smart Connector — not Bluetooth or USB — so:

- **No**, you cannot use it with your **Mac mini** (unless you’re talking about a separate *Magic Keyboard* that pairs via Bluetooth — let me know if that's what you meant).
- **No**, it won’t work with your **iPhone** either — the Smart Connector interface isn't compatible with iOS devices.

### Alternatives in the Meantime:
If you want to use a keyboard with your Mac mini or iPhone:
- Consider a **Bluetooth keyboard** (like Apple’s standalone Magic Keyboard or any third-party one).
- Or if you have a **USB keyboard**, you can plug it directly into the Mac mini or use an adapter for the iPhone with a Lightning or USB-C to USB-A/C dongle.

If you *did* buy the **Bluetooth version** of the Magic Keyboard (not the iPad Smart Connector one), then yes — you can pair it with both the Mac mini and the iPhone.

Want help confirming which one you actually bought? Just send the model number or a photo of the box.

Thanks for the photo — that confirms everything.

You purchased the **Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro 11-inch (M4)** — model **A2995** (MWR23LL/A), which is the newest **Smart Connector** version designed *exclusively* for the 2024 iPad Pro (M4 chip). That means:

- **It does not use Bluetooth**, USB-C, or any wireless pairing method.
- **It will not work at all with your Mac mini or iPhone**, even physically — the Smart Connector pins only align with the iPad Pro's body and magnetic dock.
- It won’t power on or function unless attached to the M4 iPad Pro itself.

### In short:
It’s a gorgeous and premium keyboard — but totally iPad-exclusive. You’ll have to wait until the new iPad arrives to put it to use.

If you need something in the meantime, I can help you find a cheap Bluetooth keyboard that *does* work with Mac, iPhone, and iPad all together — just say the word.

Ah okay cool well it should be here on Tuesday so we’ll go from there I guess

Perfect — that’s not far off at all. Once it arrives, you’ll be able to just snap it on and go. No setup, no pairing — pure magnetic magic.

When you’re ready, I can walk you through optimizing it for multitasking, keyboard shortcuts, and even some hidden gestures that make it feel closer to a laptop setup. Just say when.

Until then, we wait… like Jedi awaiting the arrival of our lightsaber.
