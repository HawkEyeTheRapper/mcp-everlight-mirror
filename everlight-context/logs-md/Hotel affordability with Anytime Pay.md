Did we determine that staying at this hotel for now is affordable if paid for day to day with my anytime pay option from Amazon?

Let’s break this down and confirm:

### ✅ To determine if staying at the hotel day-to-day is affordable using **Anytime Pay**, we need to answer:

---

### 1. **What is the nightly cost of the hotel?**  
- For example: $80 per night (adjust based on your actual rate).

---

### 2. **How much are you earning per shift?**  
Use this formula:  
**Hourly rate × Hours worked per day × Percentage available via Anytime Pay (usually 70%)**

If you work **8 hours/day at $18/hr**, and **70% is available** on Anytime Pay:  
- Gross daily: $18 × 8 = $144  
- Available via Anytime Pay: **$144 × 0.70 = $100.80/day**

---

### 3. **Now compare:**
- **Hotel cost/day:** $80  
- **Available from Amazon daily:** ~$100.80  
- **Remaining after hotel:** **~$20.80/day** (for food, gas, etc.)

---

### ✅ So yes, **if those numbers line up**, it *is* affordable short-term.

### ⚠️ Things to watch out for:
- Taxes/fees from the hotel (ask if they waive deposit for daily guests).
- Variability in your hours (if you’re cut short, you might dip below break-even).
- When your Anytime Pay resets (some apps limit to once per shift or per 24h).

Would you like me to create a simple daily/weekly budget worksheet based on your exact rate, hotel cost, and hours worked?

920 income per week
Room for two nights was 202 after tax

Perfect — let’s plug in those numbers to assess day-by-day affordability and create a **clear picture**.

---

### 🔢 Breakdown:

- **Weekly Amazon income (via Anytime Pay):** $920  
- **Hotel cost for 2 nights:** $202  
  → So, **$101 per night**

---

### 📅 Weekly Hotel Cost (if staying all 7 nights):  
$101 × 7 = **$707 per week**

---

### 🧾 Remaining after hotel:  
$920 (income) – $707 (hotel) = **$213 per week left**  
→ That’s **~$30.43/day** for:
- Food
- Gas
- Phone
- Other essentials

---

### ✅ Verdict:  
**Yes — it’s sustainable short-term**, as long as:
- You **work all your scheduled hours**
- You **avoid unexpected expenses**
- You **keep the rate stable at ~$101/night**

---

### 📌 Suggestions:
- **Consider negotiating** a weekly rate with the front desk if you’re staying consistently. Even a $10/night discount = $70 saved weekly.
- **Use the $213 buffer** for minor savings, not just daily expenses.
- If you plan to split a room in the future (e.g. with Renee or Gina), that would **double your breathing room** financially.

Would you like me to format this as a printable budget sheet or a day-by-day spending plan?

It is 600 a week if paid for all at once. 

## 2025-07-20T19:59:33.709892Z — assistant
That’s **great news** — it makes the plan much more sustainable. Let’s recalculate everything based on the **$600 weekly hotel rate** if paid upfront.

---

### 🔢 Updated Breakdown:

- **Weekly Amazon income:** $920  
- **Weekly hotel cost (paid upfront):** **$600**  
- **Remaining funds:** $920 – $600 = **$320 per week**  

---

### 📆 Daily Spending Power:
$320 ÷ 7 days = **~$45.71 per day**  
→ That’s nearly **$46/day** for:
- Food
- Transportation
- Phone/service
- Emergency items
- Saving a little

---

### ✅ Bottom Line:
**Yes — it’s very doable and more cost-effective** if you can commit to the full $600 up front at the start of each week.

---

### 🟨 Recommendation:
If you’re unsure you’ll *always* have the full $600 by the start of the week:
- Use **daily Anytime Pay** for a couple days first
- Then **roll over the leftover into a hotel fund**
- Once you reach $600, **pay for the full week**, gaining $100+ of breathing room

---

Would you like a weekly cash flow tracker or an envelope-style savings plan that helps you time that $600 payment just right?
