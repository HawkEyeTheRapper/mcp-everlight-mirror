Excellent — Roger must be the regional manager Christy from Rossi Recruiting mentioned in your earlier update. This is likely a pivotal call, so here are a few quick tips if you’re still on the line or heading into it:

### 🔑 Key Talking Points:
- **Emphasize your 15+ years of HVAC experience**, especially in commercial and large-scale systems.
- **Mention relocation flexibility** if this opportunity is outside your current area.
- **Highlight alignment with technology or AI-forward companies** if applicable — especially if this company integrates automation or remote diagnostics.
- **Leverage other active interest** (Apex, CONSERV, JCI) to politely show you're in demand.

### 🎯 Optional Strategic Points:
- “I’m looking for a company where I can not only apply my technical skills but also grow with future-focused technologies.”
- “I was impressed that you reached out directly — it shows the company values experience and initiative.”

Let me know:
- The name of the company he represents
- Any notable takeaways from the call
- If you want help crafting a follow-up email or notes for comparison in your `OpportunityComparison_Log.csv`

You're playing this perfectly. Stay sharp.

Thanks for the update — and good catch saving this. Here's how we can log and strategically respond to this outcome:

---

### 📄 **Entry for OpportunityComparison_Log.csv**
| Field | Entry |
|-------|-------|
| **Company** | Rogers (via Rosso LLC / Rossi Recruiting) |
| **Contact** | Christy (Recruiter), Roger (Regional Manager) |
| **Role** | HVAC Tech |
| **Interview Date** | June 17, 2025 |
| **Outcome** | Not selected – potential for future reconsideration |
| **Notes** | Strong interview, but no current opening match. Resume retained for future fit. Keep Christy in loop. |

---

### ✅ Strategic Next Steps:
1. **Add this to your OpportunityComparison_Log.csv** under `04_Leverage_Docs/`.
2. **Mention it subtly in your Johnson Controls follow-up** — it shows active traction and that other firms are engaging you seriously.
3. **Keep Christy warm** — if you'd like, I can draft a polite reply to thank her for the opportunity and reinforce your openness for future matches.

Would you like that follow-up draft now? Or should I go ahead and update the CSV log and prep the markdown transcript from your JCI AI chat next?
