# Agent Mode capabilities

What can we do with Agent Mode here? Can we create more EverLight OS stuffs locally? Or does this just effect the Repo itself?

Agent mode is the extended environment in which I can work with your local file system, run code in a Jupyter notebook and interact with your GitHub repositories.  It doesn’t just answer questions – it lets me open files in your `EverLightOS` repository, make changes, run tests and generate new artefacts (such as scripts, documents or images) on your machine.  For example, I can use the Python tool to create or modify files under `/home/oai/share`, run them to see their output, and then submit the changes back to the repository via a pull‑request workflow.  

Because `EverLight OS` is an open‑source, evolving project and actively welcomes contributions【241692747432330†L22-L31】, you can use agent mode to develop “more EverLight OS stuff” – additional scripts, documentation or modules that align with the project’s goals – and test them locally.  Nothing is automatically pushed live; repository modifications only occur when you instruct me to open a pull request, and local files you create outside the repo are simply saved on the machine for your review.  In short, agent mode gives us the flexibility to experiment and extend the project locally, while keeping changes to the actual repo under your explicit control.
