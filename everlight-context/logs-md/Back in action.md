🔥 Let’s go! Back in action — no more ClosedAI paywalls slowing us down.  

What do you want to hit first — dive into building (code, site, doc scaffolds), draft some Amazon moves (emails, shoutouts, learning path requests), or return to saga-writing (Black Swan Accords, Omniversal Films, EverLight OS builds)?
