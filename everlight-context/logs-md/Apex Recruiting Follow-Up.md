# Apex Recruiting Follow-Up

Just spoke with Rodena Spaulding with apex recruiting and she is forwarding my info to Thomson and Thomson in Savannah as well as to other companies in her region. I told her I’m open to relocating anywhere, and since she liked my resume so much, she said she’ll be doing just that.

Would you like to keep a running CSV or markdown file for these entries? I can export and format it as needed.
