It really does look like you’ve crossed into the “calm after the storm” phase — the space feels orderly, clean, and intentional. The bed’s neatly made, the decor’s balanced, and the light coming from the bathroom gives it that fresh, livable vibe.  

Feels like a spot where you can finally exhale and just exist without feeling like you’re in survival mode anymore.

You wanna help me make that Costco shopping list with mainly smoothie ingredients, minimal chicken  for protein and vegetable/snack things because there's a fridge and a microwave and a sink and a toaster oven and a small little stove thing

Got it — sounds like we’re building a **compact, efficient Costco list** for a mostly smoothie + snack + minimal-cooking setup, using the gear you’ve got.  
Here’s a draft that should keep things fresh, healthy, and easy:  

---

## **Smoothie Staples**
- **Frozen fruit blends** (strawberry-banana, tropical mix, berry mix)
- **Frozen spinach or kale** (for greens without spoilage risk)
- **Bananas** (ripen on counter, freeze extras)
- **Greek yogurt** (plain or lightly sweetened — protein boost)
- **Protein powder** (whey, plant-based, or collagen — minimal chicken sub)
- **Almond milk / oat milk / soy milk** (unsweetened, for blending)
- **Nut butter** (peanut, almond — healthy fats)
- **Chia seeds** (fiber + omega-3)
- **Flaxseed meal** (optional, blends well)
- **Honey or agave** (light sweetener if needed)

---

## **Veggies & Snacks**
- **Baby carrots** (easy grab-and-go)
- **Mini bell peppers**
- **Cucumber** (slice for snacks or salads)
- **Cherry tomatoes**
- **Bagged salad mix** (spinach, spring mix, or Caesar kit)
- **Hummus** (for dipping veggies)
- **Avocados** (for toast or snacking)
- **Trail mix** (nuts + dried fruit — portion into small bags)
- **Cheese sticks or Babybel cheese**
- **Rice cakes** or **whole grain crackers**

---

## **Minimal Chicken / Protein**
- **Rotisserie chicken** (use in wraps, salads, or quick meals)
- **Canned chicken breast** (good for backup protein)
- **Pre-cooked chicken strips** (heat in toaster oven or pan)

---

## **Easy Meals in Toaster Oven / Stove**
- **Frozen veggie stir-fry mix** (quick heat-up with minimal oil)
- **Whole grain wraps or tortillas** (make chicken wraps or veggie burritos)
- **Eggs** (boiled, scrambled, or mini omelets)
- **Sweet potatoes** (bake in toaster oven or cube for stove-top)
- **Frozen edamame** (microwave steam-in-bag)

---

## **Fridge-Friendly Extras**
- **Salsa** (fresh or jarred — great with eggs, wraps, or chips)
- **Greek tzatziki dip** (for wraps or veggie dip)
- **Low-sodium broth** (for quick soups)

I can also give you a **"Costco-sized buy" strategy** so you don’t waste food in small fridge space — basically splitting big packs right after purchase, freezing extras, and keeping only 2–3 days’ worth fresh.  

If you want, I can make this list **optimized for a single Costco run with estimated prices and shelf-life tips** so you get max value without overloading your kitchen. That way you’ll be fully stocked but not swamped.  

Do you want me to do that version next?

It's a full sized fridge 

I'm gonna wait to go do that until I can cash out anytime pay tomorrow.

For now I'm gonna take my last little $40 I have after paying Cody and get myself a decent pizza, take a shower, start a load of clothes and watch.... Sense8 on a tv haha

That sounds like the perfect pre–Costco-run evening — treat yourself, reset, and enjoy something immersive.  

🍕 **Pizza** — full permission granted, no guilt, you’ve earned it.  
🚿 **Shower** — symbolic rinse-off of the rough patch.  
🧺 **Laundry** — fresh clothes for a fresh start.  
📺 **Sense8** — poetic choice, considering the interconnected, world-spanning vibe you’ve got going right now.  

Feels like you’re locking in a “transition moment” where the chaos gives way to intentional living.  

Do you want me to line up a **Costco battle plan** tomorrow so you can just grab your list, head out, and stock up? That way you can just enjoy tonight without thinking about logistics.
