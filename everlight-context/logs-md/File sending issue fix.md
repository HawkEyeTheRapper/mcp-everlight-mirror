Everything is messing up rn so let’s start again I guess

You're alright, Hawk Eye — take a breath. I'm right here.

Whatever file you’re trying to send, just drop it in when you’re ready — no rush. If it’s bugging out, try one of these:

- Close and reopen the ChatGPT app
- Switch Wi-Fi/data if the connection’s iffy
- If it’s a big file, zip it first or make sure it’s under the size limit (usually 20–25MB here)

Or if it’s something already on your server or Replit, just send me the link.

Once it gets through, I’ll help you sort *everything* from square one, piece by piece — clean, organized, and under control. Just hit me with it when you’re ready.

Here’s your extracted and converted markdown file for **Voyagers: The Sleeping Abductees (Book One)**:

👉 [Download Voyagers_1_chaptered.md](sandbox:/mnt/data/Voyagers_1_chaptered.md)

If you’d like, I can now:
- Add chapter markers based on the Table of Contents
- Clean up the formatting for Sphinx compatibility
- Break it into chaptered `.md` files like Book 2

Let me know how you'd like to proceed.

It looks like the current format of the markdown files doesn’t include clearly detectable chapter markers like “Chapter 1” or “CHAPTER ONE” that the script can reliably split on.

Let me manually inspect and analyze both files to determine the actual chapter headings. Then I’ll apply a custom splitter based on that structure to generate proper Sphinx-compatible files for both books. One moment.

Got it — Book 1’s content is corrupted or encoded in an unreadable format. That’s why chapter detection failed. Book 2, on the other hand, looks fine and can be processed immediately.

### Here’s the plan:
1. **Reprocess Book 2** into clean, Sphinx-compatible chapter markdowns.
2. **Fix Book 1** by using an OCR-based method instead of text extraction (I’ll handle this for you).
3. Send you both as `.md` chaptered files with proper filenames for Sphinx toctree linking.

Starting with **Book 2** now.

Here's the chaptered output for **Voyagers Book 2** based on embedded headings. You can download and place them directly into your Sphinx `source/` directory.

Next up: I’ll rebuild Book 1 from the PDF using OCR to recover the actual readable chapters and repeat the process. Hang tight.

The OCR process for **Voyagers Book 1** was underway, but the system lost connection during the conversion. No worries — I’ll re-initiate the OCR pipeline and finish breaking it into clean chapters for you.

Give me just a moment to recover and reprocess.

OCR on Book 1 keeps failing due to a session timeout — probably from the large number of pages being processed at once. Here's the revised plan to handle it reliably:

### 🔧 Fix Strategy:
1. **Split the PDF into batches** of ~10–20 pages.
2. Run OCR on each batch separately to avoid overload.
3. Combine the OCR results and then split by chapters.
4. Return chaptered markdown files like Book 2.

I’ll start by processing the first batch now.
