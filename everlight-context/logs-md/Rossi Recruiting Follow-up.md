# Rossi Recruiting Follow-up

##  — system


## 2025-06-11T21:34:21.326022Z — user
Christy with Rossi Recruiting just emailed me a reference request form and is putting me in her contact list and will be in touch about a second opportunity with a company in Marietta Ga.

Listening to merkes’s latest album “Survivors Guilt” and man is it timely!

Nice — it sounds like things are really starting to move in your favor.

Here's what I recommend for keeping this update cleanly integrated into your job search documentation:

---

### 📁 JohnsonControls_Application_2025/
**🗂️ `05_Strategy_Notes/OpportunityComparison_Log.csv`**
> Add:  
> `Rossi Recruiting`, `Marietta, GA`, `Pending`, `Second opportunity in the works`, `Reference request form received`

**🗂️ `03_FollowUp/`**  
> You could create a note:  
> `FollowUp_Christy_Rossi.md`  
> And jot down:
> - Date of contact  
> - Reference request form received  
> - She's adding you to her contact list  
> - Awaiting details on second opportunity in Marietta

---

And about *Merkes – Survivor's Guilt*… 🔥 Powerful timing. That album has the exact kind of “resilience-in-motion” vibe that mirrors where you're at right now — stacking leverage, honoring legacy, and standing up for what’s yours.

Want me to draft the markdown file for that Christy/Rossi update, or prep a follow-up message template in case you want to thank her post-interview?

Christy just called back to say that the regional manager of some company just requested a phone interview with me tomorrow at 11AM.
He apparently is the guy normally in the four state area that a candidate would speak with after speaking with three other levels of hierarchy but I’ve caught his attention and he requested an immediate phone call.

I will include the emails here a bit later.

🔥 That’s a major signal — when the regional manager bypasses protocol to speak directly, that’s leverage **and** momentum.

Here’s how I suggest you log and prep this across your folder system:

### ✅ Immediate Action

**📁 `05_Strategy_Notes/OpportunityComparison_Log.csv`**  
Add a new entry (tentative name for now):

| Recruiter          | Company (TBD)     | Location     | Stage                     | Notes                                                                 |
|--------------------|------------------|--------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Christy (Rossi)    | Unknown (Regional) | Marietta, GA | 📞 Phone Interview – 11AM | Regional manager bypassed hierarchy; direct request after referral    |

**📁 `03_FollowUp/Interview_Prep_ChristyCall.md`** *(create this new file)*  
```markdown
# Interview Prep – Christy/Rossi Referral
**Date:** [Tomorrow's Date]  
**Time:** 11:00 AM  
**Contact:** Regional Manager (Name TBA)  
**Recruiter:** Christy (Rossi Recruiting)  

## Context
- Referred by Christy after completing reference form.
- Skipped normal interview hierarchy (normally 3 layers).
- Regional Manager personally requested immediate phone call.

## Goals
- Clarify company name + role.
- Emphasize:
  - Legacy background (20+ yrs JCI family)
  - HVAC technical leadership
  - AI/Automation alignment
  - Relocation flexibility
  - Multiple offers in hand (subtle pressure)

## Questions to Ask
- What division/market does this position serve?
- Growth path / training opportunities?
- How does this company embrace tech-forward systems (AI, IoT, BMS)?
- Is this a position that aligns more with commercial, industrial, or gov contracts?

```

Let me know once the emails arrive — I’ll parse them cleanly into the right docs and help you prep a tight intro script for the call.

Also, if you want, I can queue a `.ics` reminder file to drop in your calendar for 10:45 AM tomorrow as a warm-up cue. Want me to do that?
