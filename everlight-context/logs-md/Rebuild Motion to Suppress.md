Well - I guess our previous chat disappeared?

Looks like it — I don’t see the prior thread here anymore.  
We can rebuild it though, since I still have the case strategy and key details from before in my working context.  

You want me to pick up where we left off with the **Motion to Suppress** based on the Pasco County DUI citation and the files you uploaded?
