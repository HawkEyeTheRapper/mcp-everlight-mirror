What’s your thoughts on the best order for these top to bottom

To determine the best order for the Seasonal Product Team, we should prioritize vendors that score high in:

- **Flexibility** (important for adapting to seasonal needs)
- **Low customer issues** (reliability)
- **High quantity shipped**
- **On-time shipping**

Here’s a breakdown of the vendors from the image:

### Vendor P
- Flexibility: High
- Customer Issues: Low
- Quantity Shipped: High
- Shipped On Time: High  
**Trend: No change**

### Vendor K
- Flexibility: Moderate
- Customer Issues: High
- Quantity Shipped: Moderate
- Shipped On Time: Moderate  
**Trend: No change**

### Vendor D
- Flexibility: High (↑)
- Customer Issues: Moderate (↑)
- Quantity Shipped: Moderate
- Shipped On Time: Low (↓)

### Vendor V
- Flexibility: Low
- Customer Issues: High (↓)
- Quantity Shipped: Low
- Shipped On Time: Moderate

### Recommended Rank Order (Top to Bottom):
1. **P** – Best across the board
2. **D** – Improving flexibility; decent middle ground
3. **K** – Mediocre with no improvements
4. **V** – Weakest in key areas despite minor customer issue improvement

Would you like me to help you prep for more questions like these from the Amazon assessment?
