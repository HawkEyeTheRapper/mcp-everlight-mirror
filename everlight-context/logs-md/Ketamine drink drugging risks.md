Can you drug somebody by putting ketamine in their drink? Because that's what Cody thinks happened to him

## 2025-07-28T19:03:39.879330Z — assistant
Yes, it **is possible** to drug someone by putting ketamine in their drink. Ketamine is a **powerful dissociative anesthetic**, and when administered without someone's knowledge, especially mixed in a drink, it can cause **confusion, disorientation, memory loss, dizziness, and a loss of control**—often without the person fully realizing what’s happening until much later.

### Key points:

- **Ketamine is odorless and tasteless in low doses**, making it relatively easy to slip into a drink unnoticed.
- It acts quickly—**within 5 to 30 minutes**—and the effects can last about an hour or more, depending on the dose.
- It's known to cause **anterograde amnesia**, meaning someone may not remember what happened while under its influence.
- It can cause **hallucinations, dissociation (out-of-body experiences), loss of motor control**, and extreme drowsiness.
- Ketamine is sometimes used recreationally, but it has unfortunately also been misused in **drug-facilitated assaults** due to these effects.

### If Cody suspects this happened:
1. **Take it seriously**—this is a form of assault.
2. **Seek medical attention immediately** if any symptoms are ongoing or if it was recent.
3. If the incident happened within the past 72 hours, **a toxicology screening** (urine or blood) might still detect ketamine.
4. **Document everything** he remembers, even if it’s fragmented or foggy.
5. **Report it**—either to law enforcement or a trusted medical or support professional.

If you or Cody need help figuring out what to do next or what symptoms to look for, I can walk you through that step by step. This kind of thing is extremely serious, and he’s not alone.

So putting it in a drink definitely works ?

## 2025-07-28T19:04:41.203348Z — assistant
Yes, **putting ketamine in a drink absolutely works** as a method of drugging someone. It is **one of the known ways** people have been unknowingly dosed with it.

### Here's why it works:

- **Ketamine is water-soluble**, so it dissolves easily in liquid.
- **It has little to no taste**, especially in small doses.
- When ingested orally, especially in alcohol, **its effects can be delayed but still very potent**—especially if the person doesn’t know they’re taking it and isn’t prepared for the effects.
- **Combining it with alcohol** can **intensify sedation and disorientation**, making the person even more vulnerable.

### What to watch for:
If Cody experienced:
- Sudden dizziness or confusion
- Feeling detached from reality or his body
- Unusual memory loss or blackouts
- Difficulty moving or speaking
- Waking up unsure of what happened

...then yes, that’s consistent with being drugged with ketamine via a drink.

If it happened recently (within 48–72 hours), he should **seek a urine or blood test immediately**—time matters, as ketamine clears the system fairly quickly.

Let me know if you want help drafting a report, getting medical support, or collecting evidence—because this could be criminal.

How soon does it leave his system

## 2025-07-28T19:07:26.175927Z — assistant
Ketamine **leaves the body quickly**, so **timing is critical** if Cody wants to confirm exposure through a toxicology test.

### Here's a breakdown of the detection window:

#### **Blood test:**
- Detectable for **up to 24 hours** after ingestion (sometimes less if a low dose was taken).

#### **Urine test:**
- Detectable for **up to 72 hours** (3 days) after use.
- In some cases, traces can linger up to **4–5 days**, but that’s rare and depends on dose, metabolism, hydration, and test sensitivity.

### Key factors that affect detection:
- **How much was taken**
- **Whether it was combined with alcohol or other drugs**
- **Cody’s metabolism and body composition**
- **Hydration level** (drinking a lot of fluids may flush it out faster)

### Recommendation:
If Cody suspects he was drugged and it’s **been less than 72 hours**, he should go to an **urgent care clinic or ER immediately** and request a **urine drug screen** for ketamine and other common substances used in drink-spiking (like GHB, benzodiazepines, etc.).

Let me know the timeline, and I can help figure out the next best move.
