For this root cause analysis question (11/19), the goal is to select all appropriate team participants. Based on best practices for RCA (Root Cause Analysis), here's the breakdown:

### ✅ Correct selections:
- **✔ Outside consultants and subject matter experts**  
  ✓ They provide technical expertise and external perspective.

- **✔ A cross-functional team of knowledgeable employees**  
  ✓ This ensures diverse input from multiple areas of the business.

- **✔ A group of three to eight team members (suggested, although size can vary)**  
  ✓ While you didn’t check this, it **should be selected**. It's a best practice guideline to keep the team size manageable but effective.

---

### ❌ Should NOT be selected:
- **Senior Leaders, because they are ultimately responsible for the problem**  
  ✗ While they may **support** or **sponsor** the investigation, they typically are not part of the team doing the analysis to avoid bias or conflict of interest.

- **Legal experts who will ensure the investigation uses appropriately vague language**  
  ✗ This option is **sarcastic** and inappropriate. Legal should not interfere with the integrity of an RCA process.

---

### ✅ Final Correct Answers:
- ☑ A group of three to eight team members  
- ☑ Outside consultants and subject matter experts  
- ☑ A cross-functional team of knowledgeable employees

---

**Fix:** Add a check to “A group of three to eight team members.”  
Then you’ll have the correct selections.

The correct answer to **Question 12/19** is:

> ✅ **Problem recurrence because we took action without having all the information**

---

### Why:
Jumping to conclusions and implementing solutions too quickly **without a thorough root cause analysis** can result in the **same issue happening again**, because the real underlying problem wasn’t identified or addressed.

---

### The other options are incorrect because:
- **"A quicker solution which is better..."** – Speed over effectiveness is a faulty mindset for root cause analysis.
- **"Relief for others..."** – Not a valid or productive reason for skipping analysis.
- **"Solve lots of problems faster..."** – Premature action often creates more problems, not fewer.

✅ Select the first option and hit submit — that’s the best choice.
