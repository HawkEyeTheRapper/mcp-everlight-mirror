Checking in with you - my day started off hectic with my moms oxygen machine alerting and getting yelled at for trying to make sure she was okay - now it’s improved for me at least because I came to a friends house and applied for more Amazon positions as well as watching him play some games and just generally chilling. Good for my mental health ya know.


Question tho - should I just abandon my main phone number and only keep the business line now? Business line is $104 but personal is $150 with all the devices fully paid off ….. doesn’t seem to make sense to keep it

Thanks for the check-in, and I’m really glad you carved out a space to breathe and reset today—even amidst the stress. You’re doing what you can, and that matters. As for this question about your phone lines:

**On the surface, yeah—it *doesn’t* make sense to keep both** if money is tight, the personal number costs more, and your business line can handle all your essential needs (calls, texts, data, app logins, etc.). The fact that all devices are paid off gives you freedom to pivot.

Here’s how I’d break it down:

---

### **Keep the Business Line If:**
- It’s already tied to your most important 2FA logins, contacts, and services (bank, email, Amazon job apps, etc.)
- It has good coverage + performance
- You’re ready to consolidate your communications under a more professional and cost-effective identity
- You don't have sentimental or legacy obligations tied to the old number (like family, clients, exes, etc.)

---

### **Keep the Personal Line (for now) If:**
- You *don’t* yet have everything switched over (e.g., some crucial services still tied to it)
- You’re getting important callbacks (job leads, family, etc.) from that number
- You plan to port the number into a cheaper service (e.g., Google Voice or a $10–$20/month MVNO plan) and just receive texts/calls without paying full price

---

### **Best of Both Worlds Option:**
- **Port the personal number to Google Voice** ($20 one-time fee), so you keep access to calls and texts from it via the app—but stop paying the $150 plan.
- Use the business line full-time for calls/data
- That way, you don’t lose legacy access or relationships, but save money and consolidate your mobile identity moving forward

---

Let me know if you want help porting the number or weighing service plans. Would you be able to do the Google Voice option right now—or are we still in financial triage mode?

I’m gonna check in and see if they’ll maybe consolidate both - initially the guy was supposed to put this number onto the business account for a total of like 125 for both but he never did

That’s definitely the right move—**push for the consolidation they originally promised.** If they dropped the ball on migrating your number to the business account, they *owe* you a resolution (and possibly a credit). When you call or chat with them, you might say:

> “This was supposed to be moved to the business account when I signed up. I’m being billed separately at a higher rate, and that’s not what was agreed. Can we either consolidate both lines on the business plan for the original $125 total or escalate this to a manager to correct the account?”

If they resist or act confused, **ask for the retention department**—they usually have more authority and flexibility.

Let me know how it goes. Want help drafting a bullet-point list of what to say or ask for on the call/chat?
