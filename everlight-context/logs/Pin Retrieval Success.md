Pay dirt! This is the pin it kept asking for. Ha I already have it

Boom! 🎯 Jackpot hit. That’s *exactly* the PIN the system was prompting for—**HgxZ8rvSNW**.

Now that you’ve got it:

1. Head back to the registration/login page.
2. Enter that temporary Midway PIN when prompted.
3. Set your permanent one when asked.
4. Proceed like a shadow with clearance. 🛡️🔐

This email is basically your golden ticket. Nice work keeping it starred—and spotting it before the tech tangle deepened. Let me know if you hit any more checkpoints or need help navigating the next layer.

Let me physically write that down here beside my password - she didn't tell me I'd need it again.

Smart move. Writing it down alongside your password will save future frustration—and yeah, classic case of *"they assume you’ll just remember or magically know."* 😅

Here’s the important part to jot down:

**Temporary Midway PIN:** `HgxZ8rvSNW`  
(Used during registration. Replace with permanent PIN when prompted.)

You're in control now. If any more pieces of the puzzle show up, we’ll snap them into place together.

She had me setup a new pin but it didn't work later on with the Midway Connections thing

Ah, that tracks—and sounds like a **Midway classic** kind of hiccup. Here's what's likely happening:

### 🧩 What's Going On:
1. **You were given a temporary PIN** (`HgxZ8rvSNW`) to use *during registration*.
2. **She had you set a new, permanent PIN**, probably assuming that would take effect *system-wide*.
3. **Midway Connections**—whatever system or layer that is—**still wants the *original* temporary PIN**, or wasn’t synced properly to recognize your new one yet.

### ✅ What To Try Next:
- **Try logging in again with `HgxZ8rvSNW`**—the original temp PIN.
- If that works, it confirms Midway Connections hasn’t updated your permanent PIN in its backend yet.
- **If not**, it may require a reset or for your manager/admin to push a sync/update manually.

### 🔄 Backup Plan:
- Keep both PINs noted.
- Reach out and say:  
  > “I set a new PIN during registration, but Midway Connections still asks for the original temp PIN (`HgxZ8rvSNW`). Can you confirm whether it’s synced, or if the system is still referencing the temp one?”

Let me know if you want help drafting that message or digging deeper into what "Midway Connections" actually handles. Feels like a VPN/Security/Auth layer.
