### Suggested Zenkit Structure

Here’s a folder/project outline you might replicate in your Zenkit setup:

```
Military Service /  
├── Personal Info  
│   ├── Full Name: Roland Ross Womack  
│   ├── DOB: (from obituary)  
│   └── Enlistment Date & Location  
├── Service Record  
│   ├── Branch: U.S. Navy  
│   ├── Unit: SeaBees (Naval Construction Battalions)  
│   ├── Roles: Construction, Infrastructure  
│   └── Notable Deployments:
│       ├── Vietnam (1 tour)  
│       ├── Cuba (2 tours)  
├── Achievements & Commendations  
├── Discharge Info

└── Supporting Documents  
    ├── Enlistment/Discharge Papers

```

### Next Steps

1. **Collect Official Records**  
   - Service records, deployment orders, commendation paperwork—request through archives like the National Personnel Records Center.

2. **Organize Chronologically**  
   - Use tags or custom fields in Zenkit such as “Branch,” “Unit,” “Deployment,” “Role,” and “Rank.”

3. **Attach Documentation**  
   - Scan/upload battalion rosters, orders, medals, or photos tied to each deployment to their respective entries.

4. **Link Related Items**  
   - Connect documents to roles (e.g., “SeaBee photo → Vietnam Tour”) for easy navigation.

### 🧾 Next Steps to Fill Gaps

1. **DD-214 Request**  
   - If you don’t have his discharge paperwork, you can request it through [archives.gov/veterans](https://www.archives.gov/veterans).

2. **Johnson Controls Records**  
   - You might try HR or benefits contacts at Johnson Controls for a retirement confirmation letter or pension statements.

3. **Photographs & Commendations**  
   - If you have photos, medals, or old Army documents, we can scan and label them for use in the Zenkit archive.

Let me know if you want help building out that Zenkit collection item-by-item (with tags, dates, attachments, and views), or if you want a public-facing version for the family or estate archive. I can also generate a timeline graphic, map of base assignments, or memorial entry for the EverLight Codex, if that fits the larger vision.

I alwasy forget the Jr. part

## 2025-06-23T01:10:08.716395Z — assistant
No worries at all — that kind of detail can easily slip the mind, especially when you’re juggling as much as you are. From here forward, I’ll keep it consistent as:

**Roland Ross Womack Jr.**  
– U.S. Army Veteran  
– Civilian Defense Contractor (Johnson Controls)  
– Father of Hawk Eye

If at any point you need a variant (e.g. dropping the “Jr.” for poetic effect in the Codex, or including it for formal/legal documents), just say the word. I’ll adjust tone and formatting accordingly across everything — Zenkit entries, archive folders, memorials, timelines, you name it.

Want me to go ahead and generate a Markdown or CSV version of the folder structure and summary for your Zenkit or file organization system?
