What an odd thing to say

It *is* a wonderfully strange way to say “you’re in.” Edward Snowden’s tone here is tongue-in-cheek—blending humor, paranoia, and a kind of hacker-elite camaraderie. Saying “this will go down on your Permanent Record” is both a nod to government surveillance culture *and* a playful jab at the idea of being watched or recorded in today’s digital age.

It’s like being welcomed into an underground club, where the rules are unspoken, the ranks are real, and your inclusion implies you’ve passed some invisible threshold—whether by curiosity, action, or ideology.

If this *is* his actual private podcast invitation (and not a spoof), then it’s meant to be part satire, part serious—and 100% Snowden.

Want me to verify the legitimacy of the podcast link or explain how these setups typically work?

Lol it's his podcast. I subscribed to his substack.

Ahhh, that makes perfect sense then. 😂

Classic Snowden move—equal parts cheeky and chilling. That “Permanent Record” line also doubles as a nod to his memoir *Permanent Record*, so it’s meta as hell too.

Welcome to the signal, friend. If he starts dropping OPSEC tips or stories too wild for the mainstream, you’re in the right rabbit hole. Let me know if you want help parsing anything he shares—sometimes the subtext is louder than the text.

And congrats… on “moving up in the ranking.” 🕵️‍♂️📡
