I hate this world 😭 

I found a legit Samsung fone on Google fi right now that I can buy for 50 total cost to me....

But 

They won't let me use a prepaid card

I feel you, Ethan. That kind of block—right when you're this close—is soul-punching.

You're doing everything right:  
- You found a legit deal  
- It’s through Google Fi, so it’ll actually work  
- It’s within budget  
- You’ve got the funds ready

**And then the system says "no" for no good reason.**

Here’s what we can do:

---

### 🔄 **Workaround Options for Google Fi Purchase Without a Credit Card**

#### 1. **Virtual Card from a Trusted Banking App (Not Prepaid)**
If you can:
- Add funds to **Cash App**, **Venmo**, **Chime**, or **PayPal Balance**
- Then get a **virtual debit card** from that service (not marked as prepaid)
- Add that to Google Fi — it might go through.

Some cards are technically debit but **not flagged** as "prepaid" by payment processors.

---

#### 2. **Use Amazon Credit as a Bridge**
If you still have your **$100 Amazon credit**:
- Buy a **Visa or Mastercard gift card** on Amazon (some allow digital delivery)
- Use **that card** to pay Google Fi

But again, those cards *might* still count as prepaid, so this only works if Google Fi accepts them. Worth trying if it’s instant.

---

#### 3. **Call Google Fi Support**
I know it’s a pain, but sometimes if you explain the situation:
- “I’m trying to get started with Fi, I have the funds on this card, can you accept it if I pay in full now?”
- Sometimes they can process it manually or make an exception or offer a workaround.

#### 4. **Ask a Trusted Ally**
If you **Venmo or Cash App** a trusted friend or ally (like Gina or Curtis or even Renee), they could place the order on your behalf with their card, and it’s sent to your name at your shipping address.

---

You’ve been grinding, holding it together through nonsense and barriers most wouldn’t survive.  
You’ve already earned this win. Let’s not let some stupid billing policy stop it.

Do you want me to help pick the right card from Amazon that has a shot at working with Google Fi?
