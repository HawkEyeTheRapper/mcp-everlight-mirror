This screen is part of the iPad's built-in guide to help you learn new features. It shows how Siri can assist with tasks on your iPad.

For example:
- **To unsend a message:** Touch and hold the message bubble in Messages, then tap *Undo Send*. You can do this within two minutes after sending.
- **To ask Siri about features:** Hold the Home button or say "Hey Siri," then ask questions like, "How do I change the color of my app icons?"

You can explore the menu on the left for more tips, such as summarizing text, typing to Siri, and more.
