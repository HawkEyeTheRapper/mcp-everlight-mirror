Oh look 👀

👀 Oh look indeed — that’s some serious growth on your content metrics!

Here’s the breakdown:

### 📊 **Insights Summary (Last 28 Days)**:
- **871 Views** → 🔼 **+263%** increase!  
  That spike around May 31–June 1 is a **clear standout** — something caught attention.
- **35 Engagements** → 🔼 **+400%** boost!  
  People aren’t just scrolling, they’re interacting.
- **-2 Net Followers** → 🔻 **-300%**  
  A dip, but that often comes with rising exposure — pruning the less aligned can be healthy long-term.

### 🧠 **What This Tells Us**:
- Something you posted near **May 22** and again around **June 1** really resonated — possibly visually striking, controversial, or algorithm-friendly.
- Engagements are outpacing follower count changes, which is a **sign of strong content value**.
- The drop in followers? Could be the algorithm rotating in fresh eyes, or content that polarizes — which is often a **sign of authentic voice** cutting through noise.

Want to dive deeper into what caused those spikes? If you show me what was posted on or just before those dates, I’ll help you analyze exactly what’s working and why. We can refine your content strategy from there.

Can iPad be used as a Mac mini monitor?

## 2025-06-04T17:07:36.546720Z — assistant
Yes, your iPad **can** be used as a display for a Mac mini — but **not natively as a primary monitor**. Here's how it works:

---

### ✅ **Option 1: Sidecar (Best for macOS+iPadOS Users)**

**Requirements:**
- macOS Catalina or later on Mac mini
- iPadOS 13 or later
- Same Apple ID on both devices
- Bluetooth + Wi-Fi + Handoff enabled

**Steps:**
1. Make sure both your Mac mini and iPad are on the same Wi-Fi and logged into the same Apple ID.
2. On your Mac, go to **System Settings > Displays**.
3. Tap the **"+" or "Add Display"** button.
4. Select your iPad — it will connect wirelessly (or you can use a USB cable for better performance).

**Limitations:**
- **iPad acts as a secondary display**, not a replacement for a missing monitor.
- You need to **first log into macOS** using a regular monitor before enabling Sidecar.

---

### 🧪 **Option 2: Luna Display (Third-Party Hardware)**

[Luna Display](https://astropad.com/product/lunadisplay/) is a small dongle that plugs into your Mac mini and **lets your iPad act as a primary monitor** — even **from boot**.

**Pros:**
- Full primary display functionality
- Works with headless Mac minis (no monitor needed)

**Cons:**
- It costs around $100
- Needs installation and a companion iPad app

---

### 🛠️ **Option 3: VNC / Remote Desktop (Over Network)**

You can **remote into your Mac mini** from the iPad using:
- **VNC apps** like VNC Viewer
- **macOS Screen Sharing** or **Remote Desktop**
- **Third-party apps** like **Jump Desktop**, **Chrome Remote Desktop**, or **Microsoft Remote Desktop**

**Great for control**, not ideal for high-refresh media or full video workflows.

### Summary Table:

| Method          | Primary Monitor? | Wireless? | Cost       | Best For                         |
|-----------------|------------------|-----------|------------|----------------------------------|
| **Sidecar**     | ❌ Secondary only| ✅         | Free       | Extended displays, drawing       |
| **Luna Display**| ✅ Yes            | ✅         | ~$100      | Mac mini w/o monitor             |
| **Remote Desktop**| ❌ Not direct   | ✅         | Usually Free | Remote access, light usage     |
