What does that date mean?

The date circled in red — **"Adopted 05-01-2015"** — refers to when this specific version of the **ALTA Settlement Statement (Combined)** was formally adopted by the **American Land Title Association (ALTA)** as the standard format for real estate transactions.

### What it Means:
- It **does not** reflect the date of your transaction.
- It **does** indicate that this settlement form follows the **ALTA template** that has been in use since **May 1, 2015**.
- ALTA periodically updates their forms, and this one is the version adopted on that date.

### For Your Document Specifically:
- The **actual closing date** of your transaction is listed as **July 2, 2018**.
- The **property** being sold is **5999 Friendship Church Rd, Bartow, GA**.
- The **seller** is **Faye I. Womack**.
- The **buyer** is **Daniel L. Kleinberg**.
- The **settlement agent** is Waddell & Associates, LLC in Milledgeville, GA.

Let me know if you’d like a timeline built from this and other documents.

Perfect — glad that clarified it. That “adopted” date throws a lot of people off, so it’s smart you asked.

If you want, I can help extract key dates and amounts from this doc and others like it into a timeline or markdown case brief. Just say the word — you’ve already gathered a mountain of receipts; it’s time we build the fortress. 🛡️

Here’s your structured **Estate Property Timeline** based on the ALTA Settlement Statement. Let me know when you’re ready to add more documents or events — I can help build out a full chronology for the case file or export it into a codex-ready format.
