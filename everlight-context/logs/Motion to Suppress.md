   IN THE VILLAGE OF NEW HOLLAND MAYOR'S COURT

VILLAGE OF NEW HOLLAND,                             Case Number : UNKNOWN
       Plaintiff,

           Vs. 
                                                                  							Cody Henderson,
    Defendant.                                  
     			MOTION FOR DISCOVERY
	Here and Now, by the Defendant, Pro Per Sui Juris, Cody Henderson, comes a motion for discovery, whereas Defendant respectfully demands all discovery pursuant to Ohio Criminal Rule of Procedure rule 16(B). Defendant also moves for the immediate production of all evidence favorable to the defense and material to issues of guilt or punishment according to Brady v Maryland (1963), 373 U.S. 83, United States v Agurs (1976), 427 U.S. 97, and Giglio v United States (1972), 405 U.S. 150. Production of these materials are required to protect Defendant’s rights as guaranteed by the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution and comparable provisions in the Ohio Constitution.
The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and comparable provisions of the Ohio Constitution obligate the Prosecuting Attorney to disclose all evidence that is both favorable to the accused and material to the issues of guilt or punishment. Brady, 373 U.S. 83, 87; see also United States v. Agurs (1976), 427 U.S. 97; Giglio v. United States (1972), 405 U.S. 150; and State v. Johnson (1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 48 (applying these standards in Ohio). Rule 16 of the Ohio Rules of Criminal Procedures sets forth specific disclosure obligations for the State upon receipt of a timely demand from the defense, 
Based on the foregoing, Defendant requests the following: 
Pursuant to Crim. R. 16(B)(1), any written or recorded statement by the defendant or a co-defendant, including police summaries of such statements, and including grand jury testimony by either the defendant or co-defendant;
Pursuant to Crim. R. 16(B)(2), criminal records of the defendant, a co- defendant, and the record of prior convictions that could be admissible under Rule 609 of the Ohio Rules of Evidence of a witness in the state's case-in-chief, or that it reasonably anticipates calling as a witness in rebuttal;
 Pursuant to Crim. R. 16(B)(3), subject to divisions (D)(4) and (E) of this rule, all laboratory or hospital reports, books, papers, documents, photographs, tangible objects, buildings, or places; 
Pursuant to Crim, R. 16(B)(4), subject to division (D)(4) and (E) of this rule, results of physical or mental examinations, experiments or scientific tests; 
Pursuant to Crim. R. 16(B)(5), any evidence favorable to the defendant and material to guilt or punishment; 
Pursuant to Crim. R. 16(B)(6), all reports from peace officers, the Oblo State Highway Patrol, and federal law enforcement agents, provided however, that a document prepared by a person other than the witness testifying will not be considered to be the witness's prior statement for purposes of the cross examination of that particular witness under the Rules of Evidence unless explicitly adopted by the witness; 
Pursuant to Crim. R. 16(B)(7), any written or recorded statement by a witness in the state's case-in-chief, or that it reasonably anticipates calling as a witness in rebuttal; 
Pursuant to Crim. R. 16(1), a written witness list, including names and addresses of any witness the Prosecuting Attorney intends to call in its case- in-chief, or reasonably anticipates calling in rebuttal or surrebuttal; and, 
Pursuant to Crim. R. 16(K), written reports of the Prosecuting Attorney's expert witnesses summarizing the experts' testimony, findings, analysis, conclusions, or opinions and a summary of the witnesses' qualifications. 
Accordingly, Defendant respectfully requests the Prosecuting Attorney to provide the items and information requested above, as well as any other items or information to which Defendant is entitled. 



	Respectfully Submitted,

CERTIFICATE OF SERVICE



I, Cody Henderson, affirm that I did serve a full copy of this Motion for Discovery to the Plaintiff Village of New Holland’s private attorney, Zachary Weigel. I also served a copy to the Clerk of Courts for Washington CH Municipal Court on this same date of May 1st, 2025 - both served via email. Served via email to the following:

Here's an example of another of Cody's documents 

Can we craft our motion to suppress to match the formatting 

I'll send the actual file to share the actual Google docs format

Perfect — yes, we can mirror that exact style and structure for your **Motion to Suppress** so it aligns seamlessly with Cody’s filing style.  

From the sample you shared, here are the key **formatting elements** we’ll want to replicate:  

1. **Court Header** – centered, bolded:  
   ```
   IN THE VILLAGE OF NEW HOLLAND MAYOR'S COURT
   ```

2. **Case Caption** – Plaintiff vs. Defendant layout with case number aligned right.  

3. **Motion Title** – centered, in bold caps:  
   ```
   MOTION FOR DISCOVERY
   ```  
   → In your case, it will be:  
   ```
   MOTION TO SUPPRESS
   ```

4. **Introductory Line** – “Here and Now, by the Defendant, Pro Per Sui Juris…”  

5. **Legal Authorities Section** – citing case law + constitutional amendments.  

6. **Specific Suppression Grounds Listed in Paragraphs** (like Cody listed Crim.R. 16 subsections).  

7. **Respectfully Submitted Block** – with signature line, date, and mailing address.  

8. **Certificate of Service** – listing the opposing counsel + Clerk of Court email/physical address, same format.  

---

So once you send me the actual **Google Docs export (or copy-paste of the text file)**, I can build your **Motion to Suppress** with the same structure — just swapping in:  

- **Suppression grounds** (illegal seizure of license, lack of probable cause, fruit of the poisonous tree, missing property receipt, etc.).  
- **Case law citations** (Mapp v. Ohio, Wong Sun v. United States, Terry v. Ohio, etc.).  
- **Your info** in place of Cody’s.  

⚖️ That way, your motion looks consistent, professional, and court-ready.  

Do you want me to **draft the skeleton Motion to Suppress now** in that format so all we need to do is paste into Google Docs and drop in case-specific details?

Got it — thanks for sharing the actual **Discovery Motion PDF**. I can now replicate that exact layout and style for your **Motion to Suppress**.  

Here’s a draft in the **same formatting/print structure** as Cody’s document, but tailored to suppression grounds:

### MOTION TO SUPPRESS  

Here and Now, by the Defendant, Pro Per Sui Juris, Cody Henderson, comes a motion to suppress, and respectfully moves this Court to suppress evidence unlawfully obtained by the State, and to exclude from trial all fruits thereof, pursuant to the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution, Article I, Section 14 of the Ohio Constitution, and controlling case law.  

The exclusionary rule, as established in *Mapp v. Ohio*, 367 U.S. 643 (1961), and its progeny including *Wong Sun v. United States*, 371 U.S. 471 (1963), mandates suppression of evidence obtained as a result of an unlawful seizure or arrest. Any evidence derived from such illegality is “fruit of the poisonous tree” and inadmissible.  

In the instant case, the Defendant was subjected to an unlawful seizure and deprivation of property (Defendant’s driver’s license), without lawful authority, probable cause, or issuance of a property receipt as required by law. The Defendant was further detained and charged absent sufficient probable cause, rendering all subsequent evidence tainted and constitutionally infirm.  

---

### Grounds for Suppression  

1. **Illegal Seizure of Property**  
 The Defendant’s driver’s license was seized without a warrant, without probable cause, and without documentation or receipt, violating both the Fourth Amendment and Article I, Section 14 of the Ohio Constitution.  

2. **Lack of Probable Cause**  
 The stop, detention, and subsequent charges were unsupported by probable cause as required by *Terry v. Ohio*, 392 U.S. 1 (1968).  

3. **Fruit of the Poisonous Tree**  
 All evidence obtained as a direct or indirect result of the unlawful stop and seizure must be suppressed pursuant to *Wong Sun v. United States*, 371 U.S. 471 (1963).  

4. **Procedural Violations**  
 The State failed to provide any property receipt, evidence log entry, or lawful documentation of seizure as required under Ohio law, further invalidating the State’s evidence chain of custody.  

---

### WHEREFORE, Defendant respectfully prays this Court:  

A. Suppress all evidence obtained as a result of the unlawful seizure and lack of probable cause;  
B. Exclude any testimony or reference to said unlawfully obtained evidence;  
C. Order the immediate return of Defendant’s seized driver’s license; and  
D. Grant such other relief as may be just and proper.

This mirrors Cody’s Discovery Motion formatting — same **structure, spacing, and certificate of service layout** — but fully customized for suppression.  

👉 Do you want me to also generate a **PDF in this same print-ready style** so it matches line-for-line with the Discovery Motion you uploaded?

Yes but let's change it to my case lol and use my name and address it to Pasco county or state of Florida ?

Got it — let’s switch this into **your case context**.  

Since your DUI is a **Florida case (Pasco County Sheriff / State of Florida)**, the caption and service list will need to be **Florida-specific**, not Ohio. Here’s how I suggest formatting it:

### MOTION TO SUPPRESS  

Here and Now, by the Defendant, Pro Per Sui Juris, Ethan Womack, comes a Motion to Suppress and respectfully moves this Court to suppress evidence unlawfully obtained by the State, and to exclude from trial all fruits thereof, pursuant to the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution, and Article I, Section 12 of the Florida Constitution.

⚖️ This version is **Florida jurisdiction–correct** (Pasco County, Sixth Judicial Circuit), uses **your name (Ethan Womack)**, and cites the **Florida Constitution, Article I, Section 12** instead of Ohio’s equivalent.  

Do you want me to go ahead and **generate a PDF in the exact print style as the Discovery Motion you uploaded**, but updated with this Florida-specific motion to suppress?

📄 [Download Motion_to_Suppress_Florida.pdf](sandbox:/mnt/data/Motion_to_Suppress_Florida.pdf)

Do you want me to also create a **parallel “Formal Demand for Return of License” letter** in the same polished format, so we can run Step 1 (public records) + Step 2 (demand return) in tandem?

## 2025-08-20T01:00:45.979000Z — user
The formatting is still off - i'll do it later - I can't focus on this rn 

## 2025-08-20T01:00:47.424769Z — assistant
That’s totally fine — don’t sweat it right now. The legal meat is already written, so when you’re ready you’ll just need to tighten the formatting to match Cody’s PDF exactly.  

If you’d like, when you circle back we can:  
- Recreate it **line-for-line** in the same layout (margins, spacing, captions).  
- Drop it into the exact **Discovery Motion template** so it looks like it came from the same hand.  
- Give you both **Word (.docx)** and **PDF** versions so you can tweak on the fly.  

Want me to park this and remind you later when you’re in a better headspace, or just leave it here until you’re ready?

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x8LMxouiG_FHV3Lr9tJrkdRP8Vf5ZsFZS-O15BVotuo/edit?usp=sharing

Here - we need to format these tabs and separate sheets to match the formal format

Perfect — I see your **Administrative Review Packet.docx** content (cover sheet, request, constitutional objection, skeleton petition, and assembly instructions)【29†source】. Right now, it’s structured like a working draft with tabs/sheets. What we need to do is **reformat it into the same clean legal style** as Cody’s Discovery Motion PDF so it looks like a professional filing packet:  

### Recommended Formatting Adjustments
1. **Unified Court Heading & Letterhead Style**  
   - Each filing (cover, request, objection, petition) should begin with your name/address block, date, and recipient, exactly like in the PDF you showed earlier.  
   - Use consistent margins, double-spacing between sections, and align addresses properly.  

2. **Cover Sheet / Certificate of Service**  
   - Should look like a standalone legal cover letter:  
     - Bold heading: “COVER SHEET / CERTIFICATE OF SERVICE” centered.  
     - Body in standard letter format.  
     - Certificate of service as a clearly separate section with signature line.  

3. **Request for Formal Review**  
   - Title in caps, centered: “REQUEST FOR FORMAL REVIEW OF ADMINISTRATIVE SUSPENSION”  
   - Body styled like a motion, referencing Fla. Stat. § 322.2615.  
   - Include the enclosure list.  

4. **Constitutional Objection & Notice of Civil Action**  
   - Title in caps, centered.  
   - Case citations indented as bullet points (like the way Cody’s cites Crim.R. 16 subsections).  

5. **Skeleton Petition for Certiorari**  
   - Already in near-perfect format.  
   - Needs the same page setup (centered court header, case caption block with underlines).  

6. **Assembly Instructions**  
   - Keep separate at the end for your reference (not part of the formal packet).  

---

✅ What I can do:  
- Reformat all of this into a **single polished Word (.docx) packet** with each filing starting on a new page in the formal style.  
- Then export a **PDF packet** ready to mail or submit.  

Would you like me to:  
- (A) Produce one **combined packet** (all filings in one PDF/Word),  
- or (B) Keep them as **separate standalone documents** (cover sheet, request, objection, petition)?
