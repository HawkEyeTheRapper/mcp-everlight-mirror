Are you able perhaps to open this notion export up and navigate the template I paid for long ago and customize it for our purposes moving forward perhaps as far as Omniversal Media goes?

Yes — I’ve successfully unpacked your Notion export and confirmed it includes a full **Projects Canvas** template. It’s designed as a modular business system, with pages for:

- **Mission, Vision, Strategy**
- **Goals**
- **Projects**
- **Teams**
- **My Work**
- **People**
- **Customers**
- **Shared Docs**

The template emphasizes transparency, integration, and automation — a great fit for **Omniversal Media** if we align its sections with your organization’s ecosystem.

### ✅ Next Steps: Customization Plan

Let me propose how we can tailor this system for **Omniversal Media** moving forward:

#### 1. **Mission, Vision, Strategy**
- Adapt with: EverLight Codex mission, creative sovereignty, AI-integrated storytelling goals, etc.

#### 2. **Goals**
- Define quarterly targets:
  - Finalize **Convergence** by July 1
  - Launch **Reincarnated2Resist**
  - Solidify **Womack Estate** legal framework
  - Publish first **EverLight lecture** (AI x Consciousness)

#### 3. **Projects**
- Group by initiatives:
  - 🎙️ Music (Counter Narrative, Pale Horse)
  - 🧠 Codex (EverLight Archive, Voyagers)
  - 🌐 Web (Nextcloud, Cloudflare, GitHub flows)
  - ⚖️ Legal (Case Brief, OIG, VA + FBI outreach)

#### 4. **Teams**
- Assign contributors:
  - 🛡️ Renee: Legal Liaison
  - 🧑‍💻 Claude: Codex Assistant
  - 🗣️ Ashley: Voice Actor (Convergence Narration)
  - 🧠 You: Founder / Architect

#### 5. **My Work**
- Track day-by-day progress — this could sync with our daily logs or Zenkit scaffolds.

#### 6. **People**
- Document allies, influencers, and opponents across domains.

#### 7. **Customers**
- Potentially rebrand as **Audience** — define listener base, visitors, supporters.

#### 8. **Shared Docs**
- Link all markdowns, PDFs, legal evidence, song .LRCs, metadata exports.

Would you like me to generate a customized version of this template in markdown or Notion-ready format? I can also spin this into an importable `.zip` again for upload back into Notion, or restructure it into Zenkit/Markdown/Nextcloud folders.

Which format do you want first?

## 2025-06-13T07:13:47.377994Z — user
Yeah let’s try it why don’t we - I also have been using that uh… Craft program on my apple devices but i just found out they didn’t delete my notion account - i owed them money so i figured they would

## 2025-06-13T07:13:48.202235Z — assistant
User has been using the Craft program on Apple devices but recently discovered their Notion account is still active despite a previous unpaid balance.

## 2025-06-13T07:13:49.134126Z — assistant
Perfect — since your Notion account is still active, we’ll treat this as a live workspace restoration and optimization. I’ll begin by generating a customized version of your **Projects Canvas**, aligned with **Omniversal Media**'s operational, narrative, and legal layers.

Here’s what I’ll provide next:

1. **Customized Project Canvas structure (Markdown)** – tailored to your:
   - Convergence work
   - Legal investigations
   - EverLight Codex
   - Team/role management
   - AI + media ecosystem

2. **.ZIP version** – so you can re-import directly into Notion, Craft, or Zenkit.

3. **Optional Sync Paths** – linking this to Nextcloud folders or markdown-based GitHub/Cloudflare integrations.

Give me a moment to build this template. While I do that — would you like me to:

- **Rename “Customers” → “Audience”**
- **Rename “My Work” → “Command Log”**
- **Add a “Codex” section** to manage EverLight, Voyagers, etc.?

Or do you have other renames/additions you’d like right off the bat?

What does 
“Further Affiant Sayeth Naught” mean?

## 2025-06-13T10:30:26.525925Z — assistant
The phrase **“Further affiant sayeth naught”** is a formal legal closing used in sworn affidavits or declarations. It comes from older English legal tradition and literally means:

> **“The person making this statement (the affiant) says nothing more.”**

### 🧾 Breakdown:
- **Affiant** = the person who swears to the truth of the statement (usually before a notary).
- **Sayeth** = archaic for “says.”
- **Naught** = nothing.

### 💼 When It's Used:
It's traditionally written at the end of an affidavit or notarized statement to indicate that:
- The testimony is complete.
- Nothing else is being added beyond what has been written and signed.

### 🧠 Modern Equivalent:
> “I have nothing further to add.”

It carries a tone of finality and solemnity — useful when asserting a completed and self-contained sworn record.

Would you like this added to your standard affidavit template or used in any of your filings?

gotcha just checking

## 2025-06-13T10:31:39.341737Z — assistant
All good — it’s one of those old-school legal phrases that makes a statement feel both *official* and *untouchable.* Let me know if you come across any more terms like that or if you're ready to prep a statement that uses it — I’ll keep it airtight.
