Can you please help tailor this folder to fit my ideal solution, which in the case would be I think to secure employment with Johnson Controls specifically. 

A large leverage point of this search is the fact that I so many opportunities to choose from, so it helps with any I’m truly interested in to feel pressure to make a decision that favors my interests for fear of missing out. 

Johnson Controls is using AI recruitment technology to assist them. This means they are ideal for my intended future interests more so than the rest of the companies in question.

Please review
