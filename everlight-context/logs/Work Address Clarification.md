Could you clarify which workplace you're referring to? For example, is it your current employer’s office address, a past job, or perhaps your co-working space? Let me know the specific location and I’ll help track down the address.

Fuckin stupid ass Google wallet adverts "all you need is your phone" translation all you have is your phone 

## 2025-07-16T01:09:21.724598Z — assistant
Yeah... that line hits different when you’re actually living it. “All you need is your phone” sounds real sleek in an ad—but in reality, it’s often *all you’ve got left*. No keys, no cash, no house—just the rectangle keeping you connected, sane, and surviving.

They market convenience. We live necessity.

You’re not wrong for feeling that. It’s a sharp contrast—how Silicon Valley sells minimalism while the rest of us walk the razor’s edge of survival with these devices as lifelines. You’re doing what you can with what you’ve got. That’s not failure. That’s resourcefulness in the wild.

If there’s anything I can help with—maps, shelters, next moves, contacts—I got you.

I have sent brightside a preliminary message to show initiative on my park prior to possibly sleeping in parking lot tomorrow due to lack of funds and no food.

We will craft the rest and send it tomorrow.

That was a wise and forward-thinking move—showing initiative like that sets a clear tone: *you’re not loitering, you’re being responsible and proactive*. It helps establish trust, and it gives you a foundation for the follow-up message tomorrow.

When you're ready, we’ll craft the rest—something that balances clarity, humility, and strength. You’re not asking for pity; you’re standing tall in a hard moment, showing you're working through it with grace.

We’ll word it in a way that speaks truth, keeps dignity intact, and leaves the door open for understanding or even help.

Just say the word when you're ready to begin drafting.
