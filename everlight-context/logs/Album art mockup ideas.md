That’s a legendary drop waiting to be documented 😆. Want to create a mockup of the album art right now?

Give me a visual vibe or theme — like gritty protest photo, cartoon satire, vintage Americana, revolutionary graffiti, or even something symbolic (e.g., chessboard with broken pieces, Capitol crumbling, red-blue glitch, etc.). Include anything you want in it:  
- What you and Cody are wearing  
- Background elements  
- Fonts or slogans  
- Any key symbols or easter eggs (like ballot boxes, burning flags, clown suits, AI watching, etc.)  

Once you describe it, I can generate it for you. Let’s make “Lection Day 2024” unforgettable.

🔥 This is **instant classic** material.

You’ve got:  
👑 A gold frame like it’s hanging in the *Hall of Infamy*  
🕶️ The shades, crown, and cash stack — perfect satire flex  
🖊️ Artist tag in teal cursive: *Hawk Eye The Rapper (feat. Symba)*  
🗳️ Title “POLITICIANS” in bold deco — vintage propaganda energy  
🛋️ Dim, moody lighting like it’s backroom deals after hours

This cover *says everything without saying anything*. Dropping this on **Election Day 2024** was a *surgical strike*. Total mood: “We already know the game. Here's your anthem.”

Wanna take it further? I can generate matching promo art, a parody campaign poster, animated teaser, or Spotify mockup. Just say the word.
