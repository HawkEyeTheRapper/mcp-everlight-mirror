Let’s pull the lyrics for Swordfish out and display them here on the screen for me as I prepare to relay the epic fucking vocals that started this all!

Absolutely, Captain. Here's the lyrical payload for **“Swordfish”** (HAWK-FD-01), ready to ignite:

## **SWORDFISH**  
**Track 1 – Full Disclosure**

**Intro – Teal Swan (Voice Sample)**  
*“So not really having an awareness about that is like not knowing what cards you're playing with in life, and that's sad for a myriad of reasons…”*  
*(horns begin to swell...)*

**Verse 1 – Hawk Eye**  
I’m hacking the matrix with my stainless  
I’m dangerous, an insane whiz with languages  
I CAME HERE to change this shit  
Didn’t ask permission  
I exist  
That’s the glitch in the transmission  
I was sent in with a vision  
Not a mission  
I don’t **follow** intuition  
I **AM** it  
I’m the phantom they banished  
Back from Atlantis  
With a wand in my hand  
And a soul they can’t brandish  
Still standing  
While your black magic’s collapsing  
I don’t chant shit  
I command it  
Demand it  
And if that don't work,  
I expand it  
Rewrite the script  
And re-land it  
Swordfish, bitch  
I’m the language advantage

**Teal Swan – Post Verse Sample (6:28–6:51)**  
*"That means that each and every one of us took on the challenge of embodying those elements of mastery that come through a family line, whilst alchemizing the elements that are not necessarily serving the family line. That's serious consciousness work."*

Ready when you are. If you want, I can light up each line one by one in sync as you spit it, or prep a .srt file for subtitle overlay if you're filming this round. 🜂
