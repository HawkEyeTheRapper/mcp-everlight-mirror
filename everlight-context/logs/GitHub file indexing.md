I want you to connect to this GitHub repository and begin working with the files: 
https://github.com/OmniversalMediaLLC/SphinxGuardian

Please index all content under /Source, and use that to generate structured Markdown entries under /Codex. 
Also, update the README.md and metadata.json

Understood. I'll connect to the specified GitHub repository and index all content under the `/Source` directory. I will then use that to generate structured Markdown entries under `/Codex`, and update the `README.md` and `metadata.json` files as requested. I'll start by examining the repository structure and files to plan the process.

I reviewed the two PDFs under the `/Source` folder and extracted their structure, themes and key concepts using the built‑in PDF parser. Based on that information I indexed the content and prepared two detailed codex entries summarising each book, updated the project’s `README.md` to explain its purpose and workflow, and extended `metadata.json` to include the new entries.

Below are the resulting files ready to be committed:

- Updated `README.md` with structure, entry list and contribution guidelines: {{file:file-36ddmvuxZKM79HDghw68hH}}
- Updated `metadata.json` containing entries for both books: {{file:file-6biDe4MKje2XRHrX4ic2MV}}
- **Entry 001**: Summary of *Voyagers I – The Sleeping Abductees*: {{file:file-UNjMKScY3LbbaoSGXh6S5b}} — draws on the table of contents and introduction of the first book to outline chapters on UFOs, Keylonta science, hybridisation and hidden agendas【531157327078095†L106-L186】.
- **Entry 002**: Summary of *Voyagers II – Secrets of Amenti*: {{file:file-WHwFtFNEBW7ZsVmXfd7KWM}} — maps out the major chapters of the second volume, from Amenti transmissions and seeding experiments to ascension mechanics and Guardian Alliance updates【126639197193535†L96-L176】.

These files provide a structured index and summarised references for the source materials. Let me know if you’d like me to proceed with creating a pull request on GitHub to add them to the repository.

I’m glad you’d like to proceed. However, the GitHub connector currently installed only provides read‑only access to your repositories and doesn’t allow the creation of branches or pull requests for repositories outside the installed list. As a result, I’m unable to open a PR automatically for `OmniversalMediaLLC/SphinxGuardian`.

To update the repository manually, you can:

1. Download the updated files I prepared:
   - `README.md`: {{file:file-36ddmvuxZKM79HDghw68hH}}
   - `metadata.json`: {{file:file-6biDe4MKje2XRHrX4ic2MV}}
   - `Codex/Entry_001_Voyagers_I_The_Sleeping_Abductees.md`: {{file:file-UNjMKScY3LbbaoSGXh6S5b}}
   - `Codex/Entry_002_Voyagers_II_Secrets_of_Amenti.md`: {{file:file-WHwFtFNEBW7ZsVmXfd7KWM}}

2. Add these files to the respective locations in your repository (`/Codex` directory and root).

3. Commit the changes and push them to the `main` branch of `OmniversalMediaLLC/SphinxGuardian`.

If you’d like me to push changes automatically in future, please install the GitHub connector for that repository. Let me know if there is anything else I can do!

Connecting the repository via the GitHub connector is sufficient to allow this environment to fetch files and search within your repo. However, the connector only supports read‑level operations—it doesn’t currently expose endpoints to create branches, commit files, or open pull requests on your behalf. Because of this, even with the repo connected, I still can’t push changes from here.

If you want the updates in your repository, you’ll need to commit them manually (using the files I provided) or use your own GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) outside of this environment to automate the push. Let me know if you need guidance on applying the changes manually!

Here are direct download links for the updated files—you can click each one to download them and then add them to your repository manually:

- Updated `README.md`: {{file:file-36ddmvuxZKM79HDghw68hH}}
- Updated `metadata.json`: {{file:file-6biDe4MKje2XRHrX4ic2MV}}
- New Codex entry for Voyagers I: {{file:file-UNjMKScY3LbbaoSGXh6S5b}}
- New Codex entry for Voyagers II: {{file:file-WHwFtFNEBW7ZsVmXfd7KWM}}

For convenience, I also packaged all of the updated files (including the Codex directory) into a single archive. You can download it here:

- **Archive of all updates:** {{file:file-U2D1xzA3MGbk7SCE5JzKqq}}

Once downloaded, extract the archive and copy its contents (the `Codex` folder, `README.md`, and `metadata.json`) into the root of your `SphinxGuardian` repository before committing. Let me know if you need any help with that!

I’m sorry, but I can’t provide a verbatim transcript of the entire book because it’s a copyrighted text. I can, however, continue to analyse and summarise its contents for you.

The first chapter of *Voyagers I* begins by framing “UFOs” as both mechanically perceivable craft and luminous formations. It emphasises that many sightings involve vehicles operating within our familiar three‑dimensional space and that some of these craft originate from secret terrestrial programmes—referred to as the “Interior Government”—rather than extraterrestrial sources【531157327078095†L2251-L2354】. The authors argue that mainstream investigators often try to fit such phenomena into existing scientific assumptions (e.g., that Earth’s 3‑D reality is the only true reality), which prevents them from asking the “right questions” about physics, time and perception【531157327078095†L2266-L2324】. They suggest that understanding UFOs requires recognising non‑linear time, multiple frequency bands and overlaying timelines—concepts more aligned with quantum physics than classical science【531157327078095†L2314-L2324】.

Throughout the rest of the volume, the text expands on these themes by:

- **Exploring visitor types and agendas:** Chapters detail various extraterrestrial groups (Zeta Reticuli, Grey hybrids, Aethians, etc.), their motives and the genetic experiments or interventions they conduct, alongside covert human programmes【531157327078095†L2251-L2354】.
- **Introducing Keylonta science:** The book explains how sound and symbol codes (Keylonta) underpin morphogenetic fields and how this physics allows interdimensional travel and reality manipulation.
- **Outlining human origins and hybrid lineages:** It describes the twelve parent Tribes, the Silicate Matrix genetic template and the hybridisation experiments that shaped present‑day humanity.
- **Warning of control mechanisms:** Topics include frequency fences, holographic inserts and mind‑control technologies used by negative factions.
- **Offering personal exercises:** Later chapters provide meditation and dream‑time techniques meant to help individuals develop intuition, recall abduction experiences and align with Guardian protection.

In summary, *Voyagers I – The Sleeping Abductees* combines cosmology, extraterrestrial contact narratives and metaphysical teachings to encourage readers to reconsider conventional views of physics and human history while empowering them with tools for personal awareness.
