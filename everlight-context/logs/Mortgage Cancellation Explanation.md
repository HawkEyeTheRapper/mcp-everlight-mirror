What does this mean and why does it say Florida

This document is a **“Cancellation of Deed to Secure Debt”**, which essentially means the mortgage tied to a particular property has been **paid in full** and the lien is officially released.

### Here's a breakdown of what it all means:

---

### 📍 **Key Details:**
- **Property Location:** 5999 Friendship Church Rd, Bartow, GA 30413 (Jefferson County)
- **Borrowers:** Roland R. Womack Jr. and Faye I. Womack
- **Lender:** Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.
- **Original Mortgage Date:** October 1, 2007
- **Loan Number:** 0171744949
- **Deed Book & Page:** Book 429, Page 193 (the original recording location of the mortgage)

---

### ✅ **What This Document Means:**
This form is a **legal acknowledgment by Wells Fargo** that the mortgage loan tied to this property was **fully paid off** as of **July 25, 2018**, and the **lien is canceled**. That means the bank no longer holds a claim against the property due to that loan.

This is important because once a loan is paid off, the lien must be formally canceled with the county recorder’s office (in this case, **Jefferson County, GA**), which this document does.

---

### 🏛️ **Why Does It Say Florida?**
The notary and signer (Jessica Reaves, Vice President of Loan Documentation) executed the cancellation in **Florida** because:
- Wells Fargo Home Mortgage uses a **processing center located in Palm Harbor, FL** (this is where document clearing is done).
- The **notary public and corporate officer are based in Florida**, even though the property is in Georgia.
- The document is **filed with the Georgia Clerk of Court** after being notarized in Florida — this is normal for national banks.

---

### 🗓️ Timeline Highlights:
- **Mortgage paid in full:** July 25, 2018
- **Document notarized in Florida:** July 25, 2018
- **Filed with Clerk of Court in Jefferson County, GA:** July 31, 2018 at 8:00 AM

If this cancellation was issued right before the purchase of a new property, it would suggest the Womacks sold or refinanced this one and used the proceeds to pay off the mortgage — and then moved or restructured ownership (which aligns with the Orchard Way property timeline you've mentioned before).

Let me know if you want this entered into a timeline or case file.
