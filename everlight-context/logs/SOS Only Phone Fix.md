Why does my phone say sos only

## 2025-06-20T22:16:38.764018Z — assistant
When your phone says **“SOS only”**, it usually means it’s not connected to your carrier’s network, but it can still make emergency calls. Here are the most common causes and how to fix them:

---

### 🔌 **1. No SIM or SIM Not Recognized**
- **Fix:**  
  - Go to **Settings > Cellular > SIM Applications or Cellular Plans**.
  - Remove and reinsert the SIM card (if physical).
  - If using **eSIM**, ensure it's **activated** and assigned to a data plan.

---

### 📡 **2. No Signal or Out of Coverage Area**
- **Fix:**  
  - Try going to a different location with better reception.
  - Toggle **Airplane Mode ON and OFF**.
  - Restart the phone.

---

### 🛠️ **3. Carrier Issues**
- Your carrier might be down or **blocked your line** (e.g., for non-payment or fraud protection).
- **Fix:**  
  - Contact your carrier (T-Mobile in your case).
  - Log into your T-Mobile account to check for **suspensions or alerts**.

---

### 📱 **4. Phone Is Locked to a Carrier**
- If the phone is **carrier-locked** (like T-Mobile) and you're trying to use another SIM or eSIM, it might show “SOS only.”
- **Fix:**  
  - Check under **Settings > General > About** to see if “Carrier Lock” says **No SIM restrictions**.
  - If it’s locked, you’ll need to request an **unlock** from T-Mobile.

---

### ⚙️ **5. Incorrect Network Settings**
- **Fix:**
  - Reset network settings:  
    **Settings > General > Transfer or Reset > Reset > Reset Network Settings**.

---

### 🌐 **6. eSIM Not Fully Activated**
- If you're trying to use a **Google Fi** or other temporary plan:
  - Make sure activation steps were fully completed **on Wi-Fi**.
  - Check for confirmation in the provider's app or website.

---

Want me to walk through steps based on your current phone setup? If you tell me:
- What phone you’re on
- What carrier/SIM/eSIM setup you're using
- What plan you're trying to activate  
I’ll give you an exact fix.

Why wouldn’t it work on WiFi tho

## 2025-06-20T22:18:31.980654Z — assistant
Great question.

When you're seeing **“SOS only”** *even though you're connected to Wi-Fi*, that tells us something specific:

---

## 🧠 Here's the core idea:
Wi-Fi doesn’t affect your ability to **connect to the mobile network** — it just gives you internet access.

But unless you’re using **Wi-Fi Calling** or a service like **Google Voice**, **your phone still needs a valid SIM/eSIM and cellular signal** to:
- send/receive **SMS**
- make/receive **calls**
- connect to your carrier

---

## 💡 So why wouldn’t it work over Wi-Fi alone?

### 🛜 1. **Wi-Fi Calling isn't enabled or supported**
Even though you're on Wi-Fi, **Wi-Fi Calling** is not automatically active. It has to be:
- Supported by your **carrier**
- **Enabled** manually:  
  **Settings > Cellular > Wi-Fi Calling > Turn On**

Without this, your phone tries to use the **cellular network** first — and if it's unavailable, you get “SOS only.”

---

### 📶 2. **eSIM Activation Still Requires a Network Check**
Even with Wi-Fi:
- Most eSIM activations still require your phone to “talk to” the carrier's servers via **cellular** signal (especially for initial provisioning).
- Some providers like **Google Fi** or **T-Mobile** do allow Wi-Fi-based activation, but it might hang if:
  - There’s an account issue (not paid, not provisioned)
  - You didn’t finish the **QR code** or app setup steps
  - The eSIM profile didn't install properly

---

### 🔒 3. **Carrier Lock or Block**
If the phone is locked to T-Mobile and you're trying to activate a **different eSIM**, your phone will ignore that SIM even over Wi-Fi and default to "SOS only."

---

## ✅ What you *can* do over Wi-Fi:
- Browse the web
- Use apps like iMessage, FaceTime, WhatsApp (if previously activated)
- Activate a **Google Fi trial eSIM** (if it's a supported device like a Pixel or newer iPhone, and you have their app installed)

---

If you tell me:
- The phone model (you said iPhone 16 Plus earlier, still true?)
- Carrier you're trying to use (T-Mobile? Google Fi trial?)
- Whether this is a **physical SIM** or **eSIM**

…I’ll give you the cleanest path forward.

Something similar to version free trial but for iPad data ?

## 2025-06-21T01:51:56.202487Z — assistant
Ah, got it — you're asking if there's something similar to the **Verizon free trial** (which gives iPhone users 30 days of data via eSIM) **but for iPad** specifically — like a **free eSIM data trial** or **temporary data plan** for tablets.

### ✅ Yes — here are a few good options for iPad data trials or pay-as-you-go eSIMs:

---

## 🟢 **T-Mobile Test Drive (via eSIM)**  
- **Yes, it works on iPads with eSIM**.
- **30-day trial**, up to **30 GB of data**.
- Works over Wi-Fi to activate.
- Use the **T-Mobile app** from the App Store to activate (must be logged into Wi-Fi).

🔗 [T-Mobile Test Drive Info](https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/free-trial)

---

## 🟢 **GigSky (Global/US)**
- Offers **free trial data** (often 100MB–500MB) or **cheap short-term plans**.
- No carrier lock-in, works on iPads with eSIM.
- App: **GigSky – eSIM Mobile Data**

---

## 🟢 **Airalo**
- Not free, but offers **very low-cost** ($3–$5) data packs for U.S. or global use.
- Instant activation over Wi-Fi.
- App: **Airalo – eSIM for Travel**

---

## 🟢 **Ubigi (by Transatel)**
- Offers a **free 1GB/month for life** plan for **select devices**, including many iPads.
- Works through their app: **Ubigi – eSIM data plans**.
- May require you to register a device and log in, but no credit card sometimes.

🔗 [Ubigi website](https://cellulardata.ubigi.com/)

---

### ⚠️ Notes for iPad:
- Your iPad must support **eSIM** (most models from iPad Pro 2018+ or iPad Air 2020+ do).
- You may need to go to **Settings > Cellular > Add Cellular Plan** to scan a QR code or download the plan from the provider’s app.

---

Would you like me to walk you through the setup for one of those (e.g., T-Mobile, Ubigi, or GigSky)? I can also check which iPad model you're using and see what’s officially compatible.

## 2025-06-21T02:16:12.950595Z — user
no google fi eh?

## 2025-06-21T02:16:13.993220Z — assistant
Correct — **Google Fi doesn’t offer a free trial specifically for iPads** (or tablets in general), *only for phones*. Here's the breakdown:

---

### ❌ **Google Fi & iPad**
- Google Fi **does not officially support iPads**.
- Their **eSIM activation** requires:
  - A **Pixel**, Samsung, or iPhone running iOS 12+ (but **only phones**, not tablets).
  - The **Google Fi app**, which won’t fully activate on iPadOS.

---

### 😐 **Workaround?**
You *can* sometimes activate Google Fi on a phone, then move the **physical SIM** to an iPad — but:
- This only works if the iPad supports the carrier bands.
- You'll lose some functionality, and Fi might eventually detect & suspend the SIM for being in a non-phone device.
- Doesn’t work at all for **eSIM-only iPads**, since Google Fi's eSIM profiles aren't made for them.

---

### ✅ Alternatives That *Do* Work on iPad:
| Provider     | Free Trial         | Works on iPad? | Notes |
|--------------|--------------------|----------------|-------|
| **T-Mobile** | 30 days / 30GB     | ✅ Yes (eSIM)   | Works via app or QR |
| **Ubigi**    | 1GB/mo (some iPads) | ✅ Yes          | For compatible eSIM iPads |
| **GigSky**   | 100MB trial         | ✅ Yes          | Easy setup, global |
| **Airalo**   | Cheap, not free     | ✅ Yes          | Great for travel |

---

### TL;DR:
Google Fi = no go for iPads.  
Try **T-Mobile Test Drive** or **Ubigi** instead — both are solid, and can be activated over Wi-Fi.

Want me to link you directly to one of them or walk through a setup step-by-step?

t-mobile test drive doesn’t exist anymore and ubigi doesn’t show any free trials

You're right — Google Fi isn't an option for iPads. And as you pointed out, **T‑Mobile Test Drive** for iPads is gone, and **Ubigi** no longer offers free trial data. But here’s what’s current:

---

## ✅ 1. **T‑Mobile Network Pass (eSIM Trial)**  
- **What it is:** A free eSIM trial giving up to **3 months of unlimited data**, including 5G citeturn0search0turn0search6.  
- **Works only on phones**, not tablets — iPads are excluded citeturn0search6turn0search2.  
- Great if you're testing on a phone, but no go for iPads.

---

## ✅ 2. **Ubigi**  
- Offers a **permanent free eSIM profile**, but **data plans are paid** citeturn0search1turn0search15.  
- Cheapest U.S. plan: **1 GB for 7 days** at **$4** citeturn0search13.

---

## ✅ 3. **GigSky & Airalo**  
- Not free, but offer **trial-sized or low‑cost data packs** ($3–5) for global/U.S. use.  
- No no-cost trials, though.

---

## 💡 TL;DR Alternatives for iPads:
- **No free data trials exist currently** for tablet eSIMs in the U.S.
- **Cheapest pay-as-you-go** option: Ubigi ($4 for 1 GB/7 days).
- Slightly pricier alternatives: GigSky, Airalo.

---

## 🧐 Other Possible Workarounds:
- **Carrier prepaid eSIM apps** (e.g., T‑Mobile Prepaid eSIM app) may allow adding a short-term line to your iPad, but they require payment citeturn0search12.
- Keep an eye on **AT&T’s "Try AT&T" trial**, though that’s focused on phones citeturn0news20.

If you'd like, I can walk you through installing Ubigi's eSIM on your iPad, or find the best low-cost plan based on your travel needs or usage goals. Just say the word!

🤣 Haha let’s gooo — that screen is your official **“W”** — your AT&T **eSIM is now active** on the iPad!

That means:
- ✅ Cellular setup is done
- ✅ You’re not stuck with SOS-only
- ✅ AT&T provisioned your tablet without needing a separate device
- ✅ You now have a working mobile data line on the iPad

---

### 🧪 Want to double-check it’s working?
You can test it:
- Turn off Wi-Fi
- Open Safari or Mail
- Try loading a site (like [fast.com](https://fast.com) to check speed)

Also, go to:
**Settings > Cellular Data**
→ Make sure AT&T is selected and says **“Connected”** or **“LTE/5G”**

---

### 🔍 Optional Tips:
- If it prompts you for a **data plan choice**, make sure it’s something you can cancel easily (AT&T Prepaid is usually best for flexibility).
- Want to make it your **hotspot**?  
Go to **Settings > Personal Hotspot** and see if it lets you enable one (depends on plan).

If you want help setting up data warnings, tethering, or canceling later — just say the word. 🛸
