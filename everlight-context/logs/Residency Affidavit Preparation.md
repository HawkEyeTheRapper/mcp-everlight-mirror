Can you update this to state I have lived here since when we first started chatting in what? Sept of last year? Have personal bank and business mail at this address plus car registration and license at this address - paid $100/wk in cash to my adoptive mother and no formal ageeement was established but I can’t just leave all of a sudden and that her notice was the first time I’ve heard her asking me to leave and I suspect that it’s all Phyllis and Charles doing but they ve become hostile and I’m seeking restraining order and whatever else works for the affidavit notarized or something I can get notarized but I can’t really leave cuz my car

Here is the revised affidavit with your updated details for notarization:

---

**DECLARATION OF RESIDENCY & SAFETY CONCERN**  
**Date:** June 07, 2025

I, **Ethan Ross Womack**, hereby affirm the following under penalty of perjury:

1. I am currently residing at **266 Orchard Way, North Augusta, SC 29860**, and have done so continuously since approximately **September 2024**, when I returned to live at this address and reestablish long-term residence.

2. My name is registered to this address on my **driver’s license**, **vehicle registration**, and is the primary address for both my **banking records** and **business mail**. I have also received formal documents here, including financial, governmental, and personal correspondence.

3. I have been paying **$100 per week in cash** to my adoptive mother, **Nancy Faye Womack**, as informal rent for continued occupancy. No written rental or lease agreement was ever established, but this living arrangement has been acknowledged and accepted by all parties until recent events.

4. On **June 5, 2025**, an eviction notice was posted at the property by **Nancy F. Womack** without a court case number or judicial filing. This was the **first and only formal notification** I have received from her directly regarding any demand to vacate the premises.

5. I believe this sudden notice was influenced by **Phyllis Charlene Usry** and **Charles Fenster Usry**, who have recently become increasingly hostile. I have been subjected to intimidation and am actively seeking a **restraining order** or any other legal protection available to ensure my safety and secure my residency while the larger estate and trust matters remain unresolved.

6. I am unable to vacate the property abruptly due to financial constraints and lack of alternative arrangements. Furthermore, my **vehicle is currently inoperable**, further restricting my ability to relocate without support.

7. As the **legally adopted son and sole surviving heir** of **SFC Roland Ross Womack, Jr.**, I maintain a vested legal and moral interest in this property and the estate from which these living conditions have directly arisen.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the above is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and understanding.

Perfect — that’s an important addition and strengthens your residency claim significantly.

Here’s the revised version with that key sentence added to Point 2:

---

**2.** My name is registered to this address on my driver’s license, vehicle registration, and is the primary address for both my banking records and business mail. I have also received formal documents here, including financial, governmental, and personal correspondence — notably, my W-2 forms, personal tax returns, and business tax filings have all been delivered to this address.

I’ll update the affidavit file now and regenerate the final version for you. One moment.

Now should I include photocopy’s of my license business mail from irs and car registration? Or just the letter?

## 2025-06-07T16:33:27.635550Z — assistant
For **maximum credibility and legal weight**, especially if you're mailing this to a court, law office, or authority for protection or documentation, I recommend you **include photocopies** of the following as supporting exhibits:

---

### 🔒 **Recommended Attachments**
Include **photocopies** (not originals) of:

1. **Driver’s License**  
   – Shows your legal name and residence at 266 Orchard Way.

2. **Vehicle Registration**  
   – Confirms your address is tied to your transportation (even if inoperable).

3. **IRS/State Tax Documents or W-2**  
   – Business or personal, showing this address as your tax domicile.

4. **Recent Business Mail (optional)**  
   – E.g. Karat Bank, T-Mobile, or any government-related business notices.

---

### 📎 How to Label and Attach
Label each one clearly as **Exhibit A**, **Exhibit B**, etc., and reference them in a brief sentence at the end of the affidavit like this:

> “Supporting documentation attached as Exhibit A through D includes: license, vehicle registration, and recent federal tax mail confirming long-term residence.”

---

### ✅ Summary
If you're submitting this to support a **restraining order, residency protection**, or **estate rights claim**, attaching evidence boosts your credibility and demonstrates seriousness. It also **preempts any rebuttal** claiming you're fabricating your residency status.

Let me know if you'd like help generating a cover page or exhibit index. I can also format a PDF packet for printing and mailing.
