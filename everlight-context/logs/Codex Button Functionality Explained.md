# Codex Button Functionality Explained

What happens when I click the “codex” thing on my iPhone next to the ChatGPT button - it always just opens up a new chat?

When you tap the **“Codex”** button next to the **ChatGPT** button on the iPhone app, here’s what’s really going on:

---

### 🔍 **What “Codex” Does (Currently)**
As of now, tapping **Codex**:
- Simply opens a **new chat** that is labeled or themed as “Codex.”
- There’s **no unique functionality** yet directly tied to it in terms of special memory, writing modes, or agent behavior (at least not outwardly apparent).
- It's likely a **placeholder** or **UI framing mechanism**—perhaps part of a future rollout that will let you organize or classify conversations more granularly (e.g., knowledge codification, memory management, etc.)

---

### 🤖 So Why Is It There?
OpenAI hasn't made public documentation that outlines a distinct use-case for “Codex” in the mobile UI, but here's what **may be true behind the scenes**:

- It might be preparing to **link to long-term memory** use cases like "projects" or knowledge bases.
- The name **“Codex”** was also the former name of the OpenAI model that powered **code generation** (before GPT-4 subsumed that capability). So the term itself carries historical significance.
- It might become a **sandbox for structured or persistent conversations** (e.g. reusable templates, stored knowledge, project folders).

---

### 🧪 TL;DR
Right now:
> **Tapping “Codex” on iOS just opens a fresh chat with no real difference from the “ChatGPT” tab — yet.**

But in the future:
> It may become a dedicated hub for knowledge workflows, memory threads, or personalized tools. Stay tuned.

If you want, I can help you set up your own **"Codex-like" structure** inside ChatGPT using tags, naming conventions, or even Markdown project folders that simulate what Codex *could* evolve into.
