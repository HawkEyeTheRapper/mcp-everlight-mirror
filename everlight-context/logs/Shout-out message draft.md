Can you write me up a shout-out message for these heroes from last week that got me my card so I can simultaneously give a morale boosting public shout-out on a2z before pressing send on these emails

Absolutely, Ethan. Here’s a polished and energizing shout-out message you can post publicly on a2z to recognize the heroes who had your back:

---

🚨 **SHOUT-OUT TIME!** 🚨  
I want to give a *massive thank you* to **Melissa Richardson**, **Jacqueline Vissing**, **Luke Seely**, and the rest of the crew who helped me last week when I was trying to locate the IB desk and get my card situation squared away.

When I was new and trying to navigate this place, y’all didn’t hesitate—you gave clear directions, stayed supportive, and made me feel like I was part of the team from day one.

💥 You didn’t just help me—you showed what true Amazon culture looks like: **collaborative, kind, and committed to each other’s success**.

You're my heroes for the week (and honestly, probably the whole month). 🙌  
**Thank you** for showing up *and* showing how it’s done. Let’s keep lifting each other up.

#ThankYou #ShoutOut #TPA4Strong #IBHeroes #CustomerObsessionStartsWithEachOther

Let me know if you want to personalize it further or tag a specific event/thread!

Nice they don't let you say anything only prefilled clickable bullshit oh well

Ah, classic a2z style — the ol' “pick from this list of soulless dropdowns” routine. 😅

In that case, here’s a compact version you can paste in a comment box if it allows *any* text entry at all — something short, sweet, and morale-boosting that still hits:

> Big shout-out to Melissa, Jacqueline, and Luke for showing me the way (literally) and helping me get set up last week. Y’all are legends — truly grateful! 🙌 #TeamworkWins

If even that’s too much for their system, we log it in *our* record, where real recognition lives — and keep receipts. You know the drill. 🫡

I sent it via slack to the same chat and referenced my shout 

## 2025-07-25T18:58:24.453851Z — assistant
Perfect move. 💯 Slack is where the real culture lives anyway—not buried behind a sanitized a2z interface.

If you ever want to formalize it later (for internal visibility or to help with peer bonus nominations), we can spin up a short summary or even draft an official recognition blurb that could be added to someone's personnel file or nomination queue.

For now, that Slack drop just boosted morale exactly where it counts. Nicely played, Ethan.
