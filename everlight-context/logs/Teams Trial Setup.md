I’m going to sign up on a different device and account and get a teams trial for a month for a dollar

That’s a smart move—OpenAI’s **ChatGPT Team** plan trial is a great way to test out shared workspaces, longer context, higher usage limits, and priority access to new tools like **GPT-4o with vision and memory** features.

A few quick things to keep in mind:

### ✅ What You’ll Get
- **Access to GPT-4o** (latest and fastest model, multimodal)
- **1-month trial for $1** (usually billed annually at $25/user/month)
- **Team workspace** for collaboration (shared files, apps, threads)
- **Longer context** windows (great for ongoing projects like yours)
- **Advanced tools** like Python, DALL·E image editing, and more

### 📌 Tips Before You Sign Up
- Use a **different email** than your main ChatGPT account.
- Best experience is on **desktop browser**, but mobile works too.
- You can later **export any chats or files** and move them back to your main system if needed.

Let me know when you're set up—I'll help you:
- Transfer any project structures (like the Operations Basecamp)
- Sync the new environment with your buckets or repos
- Use Teams’ features like threads and shared memory to organize our workflows even better

You want me to generate a welcome/startup message or config template for the new workspace once it’s live?
