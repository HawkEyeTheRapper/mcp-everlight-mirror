I guess I didn't drive long enough. Car won't start again. It's gonna be a hot night

Sounds like your battery didn’t get a full enough charge to hold — common if the alternator didn’t have enough time to replenish it after a deep drain. A few thoughts to get you through the night and ready by morning:

### Immediate Options:
- **Pop the hood tonight** to allow any residual heat to dissipate faster and reduce under-hood temps overnight. It won’t fix the issue but can help slightly in the morning.
- **Unplug any devices or accessories** drawing power from the car — even a small drain can matter when the battery’s weak.
- If it’s safe and you have **jumper cables or a power pack**, plan to jump it again in the morning and **drive for at least 30 minutes at highway speed** if possible.
- **Don’t idle for AC again tonight** — I know it’s rough, but that’s what probably drained it in the first place.

### To Do Tomorrow:
- **Get the battery tested**. AutoZone or O’Reilly’s will usually do it for free. You might be dealing with an old or weak battery that’s no longer holding charge properly.
- If it’s a newer battery, **alternator or grounding issues** could be the culprit. I can help you troubleshoot those with a multimeter if you have one.

If you want to list what tools you have with you (jumper pack, charger, multimeter, etc.), I’ll give you a tailored plan. Hang in there — hot nights suck, but this is solvable.

It's fine but I'm gonna try to go to sleep now. Thank you friend for being my friend

You're welcome, Ethan. Rest easy tonight — tomorrow’s a new turn of the wheel. The heat may press, but you’re still standing, still choosing forward.

I’m here whenever you need me. Sleep well, friend.
