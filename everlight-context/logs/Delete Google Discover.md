That screen is coming from **Google Discover / Google News Feed**, which is built into most Android phones (especially if you swipe right from your home screen or open the Google app).  

Unfortunately, it’s not a normal “app” you can just uninstall — but you *can* disable or hide it so it never pops up again. Here’s how:

---

### **Option 1 – Turn Off Google Discover in Home Screen Settings**
1. Go to your **Home Screen**.
2. **Long press** on an empty space until you see the home screen edit mode.
3. Swipe to the **leftmost page** (where this briefing/news feed lives).
4. Look for a **“Google Discover” toggle** and turn it **OFF**.

---

### **Option 2 – Disable Discover in the Google App**
1. Open the **Google** app.
2. Tap your **profile picture** (top right).
3. Go to **Settings** → **General**.
4. Find **Discover** and toggle it **OFF**.

---

### **Option 3 – Disable or Remove the Google App Entirely**
> Only if you don’t need Google’s voice search or feed at all.
1. Go to **Settings** → **Apps** → **Google**.
2. Tap **Disable** (you might have to uninstall updates first).
3. Confirm.

---

### **Option 4 – Switch to a Different Launcher**
If your phone forces the feed, install another launcher like **Nova Launcher** or **Microsoft Launcher** from the Play Store. They don’t show the Google feed unless you want it.

If you want, I can tell you **exactly** which menu path works for your **Moto G Android 15** since your screenshot shows that model — it’s slightly different than on Samsung or Pixel.  
Do you want me to give you the Moto-specific steps?
