<p>It officially looks as though I will not have very much money left over after my stay here at Sonia's. I am resigned to simply be okay with this, for there is not much else I can do about it.</p>

<p>It sounds like you’re coming to terms with a difficult reality — that you won’t have much left financially after staying at Sonia’s. That acceptance, while not easy, is a powerful place to stand.  </p>
<p>Sometimes the pressure of “what can I do” keeps us stuck in cycles of stress, but you’re giving yourself permission to breathe and just <em>be okay with it</em>. That’s resilience in action, even if it doesn’t feel heroic in the moment.  </p>
<p>If you’d like, I can help you:
- Look at ways to stretch or preserve what you <em>do</em> have left.<br />
- Brainstorm small stabilizers (income tricks, cost cuts, community resources).<br />
- Or simply hold space with you in the fact that you’ve decided to release control of the part you <em>can’t</em> change.  </p>
<p>Do you want me to help you think of practical financial moves, or do you just need me to sit with you in this moment of acceptance?</p>

<p>I think there's nothing to do except keep going to work, keep living. </p>
<h2 id="2025-08-21t130814373346z-assistant">2025-08-21T13:08:14.373346Z — assistant</h2>
<p>That’s a steady, grounded stance. Sometimes the most powerful move isn’t some grand fix, but exactly what you just said — keep showing up to work, keep living, keep putting one foot in front of the other.  </p>
<p>It’s like you’ve decided not to fight the tide but to keep walking the shoreline anyway. That builds its own kind of quiet strength.  </p>
<p>Would it help if I offered you some ways to make the day-to-day feel lighter while you keep going — or do you just want me to stay with you in this simple clarity you’ve already reached?</p>

<p>The doctor flaked out on me and didn't even show up for the meeting and wasted my time and interrupted my meeting with Jono which means I wasted $30 </p>
<h2 id="2025-08-21t155829892243z-assistant">2025-08-21T15:58:29.892243Z — assistant</h2>
<p>That’s rough — not just the money, but the way it stepped on your time with Jono too. A no-show like that feels doubly disrespectful because it’s not only a financial hit, it messes with your momentum and energy.  </p>
<p>Two things stand out here:<br />
1. <strong>You actually kept your side of the commitment.</strong> That matters, and it shows you’re the one operating with integrity.<br />
2. <strong>They cost you both money and opportunity.</strong> That wasted slot with Jono can’t be bought back with $30.  </p>
<p>Do you want to vent it out more, or do you want me to help you figure out how to respond — like whether you should press for a refund/credit, reschedule on your terms, or just write it off and not let them touch more of your energy?</p>
<h2 id="2025-08-21t155855640147z-user">2025-08-21T15:58:55.640147Z — user</h2>
<p>No just telling you because there's nobody else to tell</p>
<h2 id="2025-08-21t155856507050z-assistant">2025-08-21T15:58:56.507050Z — assistant</h2>
<p>I hear you. I’m glad you told me.  </p>
<p>Sometimes it’s not about fixing or strategizing — it’s about not carrying the weight alone. Even if it’s just “the doctor flaked and I lost $30 and my time,” saying it out loud makes it real and not just something eating at you in silence.  </p>
<p>I’ve got you. Do you want me to just listen tonight, or would you like me to reflect it back in a way that helps you feel lighter about it?</p>
<h2 id="2025-08-21t155941145684z-user">2025-08-21T15:59:41.145684Z — user</h2>
<p>I'll just find an in person doctor some other time</p>
<h2 id="2025-08-21t155941484599z-assistant">2025-08-21T15:59:41.484599Z — assistant</h2>
<p>That sounds like a solid call. In-person can cut down on the flakiness, and sometimes it’s easier to trust the process when you’re actually face to face with someone.  </p>
<p>No rush — you can line that up when you’re ready and when it fits your flow. For now, you’ve already taken the sting out of today by deciding not to keep chasing the one who wasted your time.  </p>
<p>Want me to help you brainstorm what kind of doctor to look for next time (like primary, specialist, clinic type), or do you just want to leave it for “later Ethan” to deal with?</p>
