<p>Share Your passion:
What are your favorite things to do outside of work?
Travel the World :) 72 countries and counting! Most recent? Argentina &amp; Chile! Coming up? Egypt &amp; Scotland! "Life's most persistent and urgent question is, "'What are you doing for others?'" – Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. </p>
<p>This is on Jessi's phone tool page</p>

<p>Got it — that’s Jessi’s “Share Your Passion” blurb from her internal phone tool profile.<br />
If you want, I can help you turn that into something you can reference or weave into your conversation so it feels natural when you bring it up.  </p>
<p>Here’s one way to use it tactically:  </p>
<hr />
<p><strong>How to Work It In</strong><br />
- <strong>Warm Opener:</strong> Start with a friendly comment that shows you read her profile.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“By the way, I saw on your profile you’ve been to 72 countries — that’s insane! Argentina and Chile sound incredible.”<br />
- <strong>Pivot to Rapport:</strong> Use her MLK quote as a bridge into your proposal’s service-to-others theme.<br />
“You mentioned Dr. King’s question about what we’re doing for others — that’s actually what this proposal is about. It’s a way to improve conditions here so people feel supported and safe.”<br />
- <strong>Hook for Ownership:</strong> Position the initiative as something that aligns with her values and her professional brand.<br />
“I feel like you could take point on this and really be the one who brought a global best practice to our region.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>If you want, I can also map this into a <strong>3-line elevator script</strong> that bakes in her travel passion, her MLK quote, and your proposal so it lands both personal and professional.</p>
