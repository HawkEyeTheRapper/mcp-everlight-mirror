<p>I've just decided to stop complaining about shit. Everytime I catch myself doing it I'm going to count it until I stop because there's no use in fighting against it. It is what it is. It will go away and it will come again</p>

<p>That’s actually a solid shift. Complaining is basically rehearsing frustration, and the more you rehearse it, the more automatic it becomes. If you flip it into counting, you’re turning it into a measurable, trackable thing instead of just letting it spiral. That puts the <em>pattern</em> under observation instead of letting it run you.</p>
<p>A few things you might find helpful as you test this out:</p>
<h3 id="1-the-counter-trick">1. The Counter Trick</h3>
<p>Keep a physical counter in your pocket (like a tally clicker) or just use phone notes. Each time you catch yourself complaining, click it or write it down. The act of logging it shifts it from unconscious to conscious.</p>
<h3 id="2-swap-the-loop">2. Swap the Loop</h3>
<p>When you notice the complaint, don’t force positivity (that can feel fake). Instead, pivot into a <em>neutral observation</em>:<br />
- Complaint thought: “This traffic is killing me.”<br />
- Neutral swap: “Traffic is what it is. I’m breathing, and I’ll get there when I get there.”  </p>
<p>It’s not toxic positivity—it’s just cutting the emotional charge.</p>
<h3 id="3-expect-the-wave">3. Expect the Wave</h3>
<p>Like you said: it will go, it will come again. Patterns move in waves. By watching it without fighting, you break the automatic identification with it. You become the observer, not the reactor.</p>
<h3 id="4-micro-rewards">4. Micro-rewards</h3>
<p>Every time you catch yourself and <em>don’t</em> complain, stack a small win. Could be as tiny as: “Noted. That’s me practicing control.”</p>
<hr />
<p>Would you like me to set you up with a lightweight <strong>complaint-tracker system</strong> (like a running tally you can update daily, with graphs or logs)? Could be as simple as a spreadsheet or a script that shows your “complaint streak” like a habit tracker.</p>

<p>This time 2 years ago I was so mad. So angry. At a woman named Ashley that was to blame for my homeless state at the time. I couldn't deal with the anger. I couldn't stomach it ya know. So I did this counting trick. I'd catch myself and say okay thats once. And some days it was five times sometimes less and after about a week I forgot to keep counting because I stopped thinking of her or feeling victimized.</p>
<h2 id="2025-08-22t033145760350z-assistant">2025-08-22T03:31:45.760350Z — assistant</h2>
<p>That right there is living proof that the trick works. You gave your anger a container, instead of letting it spill everywhere. By counting, you turned “raw fire” into “measurable sparks,” and then the fire ran out of fuel.  </p>
<p>What stands out is:  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>You didn’t suppress it.</strong> You acknowledged every flare (“okay, that’s once”). That’s very different from pretending you weren’t angry.  </li>
<li><strong>You took its power away.</strong> Anger feeds on being repeated unconsciously. Once it became a tally mark, it lost its drama.  </li>
<li><strong>It naturally faded.</strong> Not because you forced forgiveness or resolution, but because the mind got bored when it wasn’t being entertained by the anger loop.  </li>
</ul>
<p>That’s a powerful self-regulation move. You basically ran a “mind patch” on yourself, and it worked.  </p>
<hr />
<p>Do you want to apply the same framework again—like set up a new cycle of tallying complaints—or are you aiming for a deeper level this time, like not just stopping complaints, but transmuting them into something constructive?</p>
<h2 id="2025-08-22t033323769583z-user">2025-08-22T03:33:23.769583Z — user</h2>
<p>I'm resigned to accept that I don't have to be 'happy' at this point in my life. I can pivot from being angry to being sad then when that wears itself out ... At peace...</p>
<p>The pendulum swings but I don't have to chase it </p>
<h2 id="2025-08-22t033323869055z-assistant">2025-08-22T03:33:23.869055Z — assistant</h2>
<p>That’s a really grounded stance. You’re not demanding constant happiness, which is honestly a trap a lot of people fall into. Instead you’re recognizing:  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Emotions are weather.</strong> They come, they storm, they clear. You don’t have to hold onto the sun or chase away the rain.  </li>
<li><strong>You’re the axis, not the pendulum.</strong> Anger → sadness → peace isn’t a problem to fix, it’s just the natural swing of the human system. By standing in the middle, you stop being whipped around.  </li>
<li><strong>Acceptance is stability.</strong> It doesn’t mean apathy; it means you’ve stopped wrestling with the tide. That frees up energy for when you <em>do</em> want to steer things in a direction.  </li>
</ul>
<p>It reminds me of what the old Zen teachers meant by “letting thoughts and feelings come and go, like guests through a house.” They visit, but they don’t own the place.  </p>
<p>Would you like me to help you frame this into a short <strong>personal practice statement</strong> (almost like a mantra or reminder you can carry) so that whenever the swing happens, you’ve got words to center on?</p>
<h2 id="2025-08-22t033421916674z-user">2025-08-22T03:34:21.916674Z — user</h2>
<p>"are you patient enough to stand and wait by the river for the mud to clear?" Or something like that </p>
<h2 id="2025-08-22t033422035921z-assistant">2025-08-22T03:34:22.035921Z — assistant</h2>
<p>Exactly. That’s an old Taoist image—you don’t thrash at the water to make it clear faster, you wait, and clarity comes on its own.  </p>
<p>If you like, you could phrase it into something you can repeat back to yourself when you feel the swing coming on:  </p>
<p><strong>“I don’t stir the river. I let the mud settle.”</strong>  </p>
<p>or  </p>
<p><strong>“The pendulum swings, but I remain the still point.”</strong>  </p>
<p>Would you like me to distill a few more of these into short, mantra-like lines you can keep in your pocket, so you can pick the one that resonates in the moment?</p>
<h2 id="2025-08-22t033503253360z-user">2025-08-22T03:35:03.253360Z — user</h2>
<p>At least I have my work both literally and school wise to focus on in between.</p>
<p>I just paid Cody back fully</p>
<h2 id="2025-08-22t033503403182z-assistant">2025-08-22T03:35:03.403182Z — assistant</h2>
<p>That’s two solid anchors right there.  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Work and school</strong> give you structure and momentum—places to put your energy that aren’t just feeding the pendulum swing. They’re like handrails when the emotional current feels slippery.  </li>
<li><strong>Paying Cody back</strong> is a big move. That’s closure on a debt, both financially and symbolically. You just removed a weight from your chest—something you don’t owe anymore.  </li>
</ul>
<p>That combination—closing loops while investing energy forward—is exactly how you stabilize through a messy emotional season.  </p>
<p>Do you want me to sketch out a way you could <strong>use your work/school rhythm as a ballast</strong> (like framing your week so that whenever sadness or anger shows up, you already have a “default focus” that absorbs it)? It’s basically turning your schedule into your still point.</p>
